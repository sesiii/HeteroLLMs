    "prompt": "Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle. How many sheep do Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have together if Seattle has 20 sheep?",
    "expected": "260",
    "predicted": "To determine the total number of sheep for Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. First, identify how many sheep Seattle has:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Seattle's sheep} = 20\n   \\]\n\n2. Next, since Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, we calculate the number of sheep in Charleston:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Charleston's sheep} = 4 \\times \\text{Seattle's sheep} = 4 \\times 20 = 80\n   \\]\n\n3. Then, since Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, we calculate the number of sheep in Toulouse:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Toulouse's sheep} = 2 \\times \\text{Charleston's sheep} = 2 \\times 80 = 160\n   \\]\n\n4. Now, sum up the total number of sheep for all three cities:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total sheep} = \\text{Toulouse's sheep} + \\text{Charleston's sheep} + \\text{Seattle's sheep}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total sheep} = 160 + 80 + 20 = 260\n   \\]\n\nSo, the total number of sheep for Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{260}\n\\]",
