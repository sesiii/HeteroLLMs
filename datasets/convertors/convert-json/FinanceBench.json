Increases were primarily due to 2022 special item costs for\nsignificant litigation from additional commitments to address PFAS-related matters at 3M's Zwijndrecht, Belgium site (discussed in Note 16), higher raw materials and logistics\ncosts, manufacturing productivity headwinds which were further magnified by the shutdown of certain operations in Belgium and progress on restarting previously-idled\noperations, and investments in growth, productivity and sustainability. On a percent of sales basis, these increases were partially offset by increases in selling prices.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses:\nSG&A, measured as a percent of sales, increased in 2022 when compared to the same period last year. SG&A was impacted by increased special item costs for significant\nlitigation primarily related to steps toward resolving Combat Arms Earplugs litigation (discussed in Note 16) resulting in a 2022 second quarter pre-tax charge of approximately\n$1.2 billion, certain impairment costs related to exiting PFAS manufacturing (see Note 15), costs related to exiting Russia (see Note 15), divestiture-related restructuring\ncharges (see Note 5), and continued investment in key growth initiatives. These increases were partially offset by restructuring benefits and ongoing general 3M cost\nmanagement.\nResearch, Development and Related Expenses:\nR&D, measured as a percent of sales, decreased in 2022 when compared to the same period last year. 3M continues to invest in a range of R&D activities from application\ndevelopment, product and manufacturing support, product development and technology development aimed at disruptive innovations.\nGain on Business Divestitures:\nIn the third quarter of 2022, 3M recorded a pre-tax gain of $2.7 billion ($2.7 billion after tax) related to the split-off and combination of its Food Safety business with Neogen\nCorporation. Refer to Note 3 for further details.\nGoodwill Impairment Expense:\nAs a result of 3M's commitment to exit per- and polyfluoroalkyl substance (PFAS) manufacturing, 3M recorded a goodwill impairment charge related to the Advanced\nMaterials reporting unit (within the Transportation and Electronics business).

The FAA has been working to implement safety reforms such as the 2018 FAA Reauthorization Act and\nthe 2020 Aircraft Certification, Safety and Accountability Act (ACSAA). One of these, section 116 of the ACSAA prohibited the FAA from issuing a\ntype certificate to aircraft after December 27, 2022 unless the aircrafts flight crew alerting system met certain specifications. The Consolidated\nAppropriations Act, 2023 amended Section 116 of the ACSAA, such that applications for original or amended type certifications that were\nsubmitted to the FAA prior to December 27, 2020, including those of the 737-7 and 737-10, are no longer subject to the crew alerting\nspecifications of Section 116. Additionally, beginning one year after the FAA issues the type certificate for the 737-10, any new 737 MAX aircraft\nmust include certain safety enhancements to be issued an original airworthiness certification by the FAA. These enhancements are included in\nBoeings application for the certification for the 737-10, and the sufficiency of these enhancements will be determined by the FAA. Beginning\nthree years after the issuance of a type certificate for the 737-10, all previously delivered 737 MAX aircraft must be retrofitted with these safety\nenhancements. As the holder of the type certificate, Boeing is required to bear any costs of these safety enhancement retrofits. We have\nprovisioned for the estimated costs associated with the safety enhancements and do not expect those costs to be material. If we experience\ndelays in achieving certification and/or incorporating safety enhancements, future revenues, cash flows and results of operations could be\nadversely impacted. Comparable agencies in other countries may adopt similar changes. To the extent the FAA or similar regulatory agencies\noutside the U.S. implement more stringent regulations, we may incur additional compliance costs. In addition, the introduction of new aircraft\nprograms and/or derivatives, such as the 777X, 737-7 and 737-10, involves increased risks associated with meeting development, testing,\ncertification and production schedules.\nIn addition, we have experienced production quality issues, including in our supply chain, which have contributed to lower 787 deliveries,\nincluding a suspension of 787 deliveries from May 2021 to August 2022. We continue to conduct inspections and rework on built and stored 787\naircraft. A number of our customers have contractual remedies, including compensation for late deliveries or rights to reject individual airplane\ndeliveries based on delivery delays. Delays on the 737, 777X and 787 programs have resulted in, and may continue to result in, customers\nhaving the right to terminate orders, be compensated for late deliveries and/or substitute orders for other Boeing aircraft.\nWe must minimize disruption caused by production changes, achieve operational stability and implement productivity improvements in order to\nmeet customer demand and maintain our profitability. We have previously announced plans to adjust production rates on several of our\ncommercial aircraft programs. The 787 program is currently producing at low rates and we expect to gradually increase to 5 per month in 2023.\nProduction of the 777X is currently paused and is expected to resume in 2023. The 737 program has experienced operational and supply chain\nchallenges stabilizing production at 31 per month. We plan to gradually increase 737 production rates based on market demand and supply\nchain capacity. In addition, we continue to seek opportunities to reduce the costs of building our aircraft, including working with our suppliers to\nreduce supplier costs, identifying and implementing productivity improvements and optimizing how we manage inventory.

    "query": "Answer this question: Who are the primary customers of Boeing as of FY2022? \nHere is the relevant evidence that you need to answer the question:\n[START OF FILING] Table of Contents\nForward-looking statements are based on expectations and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable when made, but that may not prove to\nbe accurate. These statements are not guarantees and are subject to risks, uncertainties and changes in circumstances that are difficult to\npredict. Many factors, including those set forth in the Risk Factors section below and other important factors disclosed in this report and from\ntime to time in our other filings with the SEC, could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from these forward-looking statements.\nAny forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and we assume no obligation to update or revise any forward-\nlooking statement whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nAn investment in our common stock or debt securities involves risks and uncertainties and our actual results and future trends may differ\nmaterially from our past or projected future performance. We urge investors to consider carefully the risk factors described below in evaluating\nthe information contained in this report.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Operations\nWe depend heavily on commercial airlines, subjecting us to unique risks.\nMarket conditions have a significant impact on demand for our commercial aircraft and related services. The commercial aircraft market is\npredominantly driven by long-term trends in airline passenger and cargo traffic. The principal factors underlying long-term traffic growth are\nsustained economic growth and political stability both in developed and emerging markets. Demand for our commercial aircraft is further\ninfluenced by airline profitability, availability of aircraft financing, world trade policies, government-to-government relations, technological\nadvances, price and other competitive factors, fuel prices, terrorism, pandemics, epidemics and environmental regulations. Historically, the\nairline industry has been cyclical and very competitive and has experienced significant profit swings and constant challenges to be more cost\ncompetitive. Significant deterioration in the global economic environment, the airline industry generally or the financial stability of one or more of\nour major customers could result in fewer new orders for aircraft or services, or could cause customers to seek to postpone or cancel contractual\norders and/or payments to us, which could result in lower revenues, profitability and cash flows and a reduction in our contractual backlog. In\naddition, because our commercial aircraft backlog consists of aircraft scheduled for delivery over a period of several years, any of these\nmacroeconomic, industry or customer impacts could unexpectedly affect deliveries over a long period.\nWe enter into firm fixed-price aircraft sales contracts with indexed price escalation clauses, which could subject us to losses if we have cost\noverruns or if increases in our costs exceed the applicable escalation rate. Commercial aircraft sales contracts are often entered into years\nbefore the aircraft are delivered. In order to help account for economic fluctuations between the contract date and delivery date, aircraft pricing\ngenerally consists of a fixed amount as modified by price escalation formulas derived from labor, commodity and other price indices. Our\nrevenue estimates are based on current expectations with respect to these escalation formulas, but the actual escalation amounts are outside of\nour control. Escalation factors can fluctuate significantly from period to period. Changes in escalation amounts can significantly impact revenues\nand operating margins in our Commercial Airplanes business.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of commercial airlines. We can make no assurance that any customer will\nexercise purchase options, fulfill existing purchase commitments or purchase additional products or services from us. In addition, fleet decisions,\nairline consolidations or financial challenges involving any of our major commercial airline customers could significantly reduce our revenues and\nlimit our opportunity to generate profits from those customers.\n6\n\n\nTable of Contents\ncommercial aircraft assembly facilities are delayed or create significant disruption to our production system, or if our suppliers cannot timely\ndeliver components to us at the cost and rates necessary to achieve our targets, we may be unable to meet delivery schedules and/or the\nfinancial performance of one or more of our programs may suffer.\nOperational challenges impacting the production system for one or more of our commercial aircraft programs could result in additional production\ndelays and/or failure to meet customer demand for new aircraft, either of which would negatively impact our revenues and operating margins.\nOur commercial aircraft production system is extremely complex. Operational issues, including delays or defects in supplier components, failure\nto meet internal performance plans, or delays or failures to achieve required regulatory approval, could result in additional out-of-sequence work\nand increased production costs, as well as delayed deliveries to customers, impacts to aircraft performance and/or increased warranty or fleet\nsupport costs. We and our suppliers are experiencing supply chain disruptions as a result of the lingering impacts of COVID-19, global supply\nchain constraints, and labor instability. We and our suppliers are also experiencing inflationary pressures. We continue to monitor the health and\nstability of the supply chain as we ramp up production. These factors have reduced overall productivity and adversely impacted our financial\nposition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf our commercial aircraft fail to satisfy performance and reliability requirements and/or potentially required sustainability standards, we could\nface additional costs and/or lower revenues. Developing and manufacturing commercial aircraft that meet or exceed our performance and\nreliability standards and/or potentially required sustainability standards, as well as those of customers and regulatory agencies, can be costly\nand technologically challenging. These challenges are particularly significant with newer aircraft programs. Any failure of any Boeing aircraft to\nsatisfy performance or reliability requirements could result in disruption to our operations, higher costs and/or lower revenues.\nChanges in levels of U.S. government defense spending or acquisition priorities could negatively impact our financial position and\nresults of operations.\nWe derive a substantial portion of our revenue from the U.S. government, primarily from defense related programs with the United States\nDepartment of Defense (U.S. DoD). Levels of U.S. defense spending are very difficult to predict and may be impacted by numerous factors such\nas the evolving nature of the national security threat environment, U.S. national security strategy, U.S. foreign policy, the domestic political\nenvironment, macroeconomic conditions and the ability of the U.S. government to enact relevant legislation such as authorization and\nappropriations bills.\nThe timeliness of FY24 and future appropriations for government departments and agencies remains a recurrent risk. A lapse in appropriations\nfor government departments or agencies would result in a full or partial government shutdown, which could impact the Companys operations.\nAlternatively, Congress may fund government departments and agencies with one or more Continuing Resolutions; however, this would restrict\nthe execution of certain program activities and delay new programs or competitions. In addition, long-term uncertainty remains with respect to\noverall levels of defense spending in FY24 and beyond. U.S. government discretionary spending, including defense spending, is likely to\ncontinue to be subject to pressure.\nThere continues to be uncertainty with respect to future acquisition priorities and program-level appropriations for the U.S. DoD and other\ngovernment agencies (including NASA), including changes to national security and defense priorities, and tension between modernization\ninvestments, sustainment investments, and investments in new technologies or emergent capabilities. Future investment priority changes or\nbudget cuts, including changes associated with the authorizations and appropriations process, could result in reductions, cancellations, and/or\ndelays of existing contracts or programs, or future program opportunities. Any of these impacts could have a material effect on the results of the\nCompanys financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\n8\n\n\nTable of Contents\nguarantees, partner performance and indemnifications. Consolidations of joint ventures could also impact our reported results of operations or\nfinancial position. While we believe that we have established appropriate and adequate procedures and processes to mitigate these risks, there\nis no assurance that these transactions will be successful. We also may make strategic divestitures from time to time. These transactions may\nresult in continued financial involvement in the divested businesses, such as through guarantees or other financial arrangements, following the\ntransaction. Nonperformance by those divested businesses could affect our future financial results through additional payment obligations,\nhigher costs or asset write-downs.\nRisks Related to Our Contracts\nWe conduct a significant portion of our business pursuant to U.S. government contracts, which are subject to unique risks.\nIn 2022, 40% of our revenues were earned pursuant to U.S. government contracts, which include FMS through the U.S. government. Business\nconducted pursuant to such contracts is subject to extensive procurement regulations and other unique risks.\nOur sales to the U.S. government are subject to extensive procurement regulations, and changes to those regulations could increase our costs.\nNew procurement regulations or climate or cyber-related contractual disclosures, or changes to existing requirements, could increase our\ncompliance costs or otherwise have a material impact on the operating margins of our BDS and BGS businesses. These requirements may also\nresult in withheld payments and/or reduced future business if we fail to comply. For example, proposals to raise domestic content thresholds for\nour U.S. government contracts could have negative impacts on our business. Compliance costs attributable to current and potential future\nprocurement regulations such as these could negatively impact our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\nThe U.S. government may modify, curtail or terminate one or more of our contracts. The U.S. government contracting party may modify, curtail or\nterminate its contracts and subcontracts with us, without prior notice and either at its convenience or for default based on performance. In\naddition, funding pursuant to our U.S. government contracts may be reduced or withheld as part of the U.S. Congressional appropriations\nprocess due to fiscal constraints, changes in U.S. national security strategy and/or priorities or other reasons. Further uncertainty with respect to\nongoing programs could also result in the event that the U.S. government finances its operations through temporary funding measures such as\ncontinuing resolutions rather than full-year appropriations. Any loss or anticipated loss or reduction of expected funding and/or modification,\ncurtailment or termination of one or more large programs could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations\nand/or cash flows.\nWe are subject to U.S. government inquiries and investigations, including periodic audits of costs that we determine are reimbursable under U.S.\ngovernment contracts. U.S. government agencies, including the Defense Contract Audit Agency and the Defense Contract Management Agency,\nroutinely audit government contractors. These agencies review our performance under contracts, cost structure and compliance with applicable\nlaws, regulations and standards, as well as the adequacy of and our compliance with our internal control systems and policies. Any costs found\nto be misclassified or inaccurately allocated to a specific contract will be deemed non-reimbursable, and to the extent already reimbursed, must\nbe refunded. Any inadequacies in our systems and policies could result in withholds on billed receivables, penalties and reduced future business.\nFurthermore, if any audit, inquiry or investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties and\nadministrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or debarment\nfrom doing business with the U.S. government.

In December 2022, the Board authorized a 10%\nincrease in the quarterly cash dividend to $0.605 per share effective in 2023. CVS Health Corporation has paid cash dividends every quarter since becoming a\npublic company. Future dividends will depend on the Companys earnings, capital requirements, financial condition and other factors considered relevant by\nthe Board.\nSee Note 12 Shareholders Equity included in Item 8 of this 10-K for information regarding CVS Health Corporations dividends.\nHolders of Common Stock\nAs of February 1, 2023, there were 24,142 registered holders of the registrants common stock according to the records maintained by the registrants transfer\nagent.\nIssuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nThe following share repurchase programs have been authorized by the Board:\nIn billions\nAuthorization Date\nAuthorized\nRemaining as of\nDecember 31, 2022\nNovember 17, 2022 (2022 Repurchase Program)\n$\n10.0 \n$\n10.0 \nDecember 9, 2021 (2021 Repurchase Program)\n10.0 \n6.5 \nEach of the share Repurchase Programs was effective immediately and permit the Company to effect repurchases from time to time through a combination of\nopen market repurchases, privately negotiated transactions, accelerated share repurchase (ASR) transactions, and/or other derivative transactions.

During the years\nended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company did not repurchase any shares of common stock.\nPursuant to the authorization under the 2021 Repurchase Program, the Company entered into a $2.0 billion fixed dollar ASR with Citibank, N.A. (Citibank).\nUpon payment of the $2.0 billion purchase price on January 4, 2023, the Company received a number of shares of CVS Health Corporations common stock\nequal to 80% of the $2.0 billion notional amount of the ASR or approximately 17.4 million shares at a price of $92.19 per share, which were placed into\ntreasury stock in January 2023. At the conclusion of the ASR, the Company may receive additional shares representing the remaining 20% of the $2.0 billion\nnotional amount. The ultimate number of shares the Company may receive will depend on the daily volume-weighted average price of the Companys stock\nover an averaging period, less a discount. It is also possible, depending on such weighted average price, that the Company will have an obligation to Citibank\nwhich, at the Companys option, could be settled in additional cash or by issuing shares. Under the terms of the ASR, the maximum number of shares that\ncould be delivered to the Company is 43.4 million.\nPursuant to the authorization under the 2021 Repurchase Program, the Company entered into a $1.5 billion fixed dollar ASR with Barclays Bank PLC. Upon\npayment of the $1.5 billion purchase price on January 4, 2022, the Company received a number of shares of CVS Health Corporations common stock equal to\n80% of the $1.5 billion notional amount of the ASR or approximately 11.6 million shares at a price of $103.34 per share, which were placed into treasury stock\nin January 2022.

For maximum and minimum VaR, diversification benefit is not meaningful as \nthe maximum and minimum VaR for each portfolio may have occurred on different trading days than the components.\n(b) Credit portfolio VaR includes the derivative CVA, hedges of the CVA and hedges of the retained loan portfolio, which are reported in principal transactions \nrevenue. This VaR does not include the retained loan portfolio, which is not reported at fair value. In the first quarter of 2022, in line with the Firm's \ninternal model governance, the credit risk component of CVA related to certain counterparties was removed from Credit Portfolio VaR due to the widening \nof the credit spreads for those counterparties to elevated levels. The related hedges were also removed to maintain consistency. This exposure is now \nreflected in other sensitivity-based measures.\n(c) Corporate and other LOB VaR includes a legacy private equity position in Corporate which is publicly traded.\n(d) The increase in CCB VaR is driven by interest rate volatility impacting Home Lending warehouse loans, MSR, and related hedges.\n(e) For the period ended June 30, 2022, maximum Credit Portfolio VaR remained elevated due to the effects of nickel price increases and the associated \nvolatility in the nickel market which occurred during the first quarter of 2022.\nQuarter over quarter results\nAverage total VaR was flat for the three months ended \nJune 30, 2023, when compared with March 31, 2023, \nreflecting increases in fixed income offset by market volatility \nrelating to commodities rolling out of the one-year historical \nlook-back period. \nYear over year results\nAverage total VaR decreased by $7 million for the three \nmonths ended June 30, 2023, compared with the same \nperiod in the prior year predominantly driven by risk \nreductions impacting Credit Portfolio VaR as well as fixed \nincome.\nThe following graph presents daily Risk Management VaR for the five trailing quarters.\nDaily Risk Management VaR\n$ millions\n0\n50\n100\nSecond Quarter\n2022\nThird Quarter\n2022\nFourth Quarter\n2022\nFirst Quarter\n2023\nSecond Quarter\n2023\n85\n [END OF FILING]",

    "query": "Answer this question: What are three main companies acquired by Pfizer mentioned in this 10K report? \nHere is the relevant evidence that you need to answer the question:\n[START OF FILING] Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies\nWe regularly monitor our position and subsequently recognize the unrecognized tax benefit: (i) if there are changes in tax law, analogous case law or there is new information that\nsufficiently raise the likelihood of prevailing on the technical merits of the position to more likely than not; (ii) if the statute of limitations expires; or (iii) if there is a completion of an\naudit resulting in a favorable settlement of that tax year with the appropriate agency. Liabilities for uncertain tax positions are classified as current only when we expect to pay cash\nwithin the next 12 months. Interest and penalties, if any, are recorded in Provision/(benefit) for taxes on income and are classified on our consolidated balance sheet with the related\ntax liability.\nOur assessments are based on estimates and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management, but our estimates of unrecognized tax benefits and potential tax\nbenefits may not be representative of actual outcomes, and variation from such estimates could materially affect our financial statements in the period of settlement or when the\nstatutes of limitations expire, as we treat these events as discrete items in the period of resolution.\nR. Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans\nThe majority of our employees worldwide are covered by defined benefit pension plans, defined contribution plans or both. In the U.S., we have both IRC-qualified and supplemental\n(non-qualified) defined benefit plans and defined contribution plans, as well as other postretirement benefit plans consisting primarily of medical insurance for retirees and their eligible\ndependents. We recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of each of our defined benefit plans as an asset or liability. The obligations are generally measured at the actuarial\npresent value of all benefits attributable to employee service rendered, as provided by the applicable benefit formula. Our pension and other postretirement obligations may be\ndetermined using assumptions such as discount rate, expected annual rate of return on plan assets, expected employee turnover and participant mortality. For our pension plans, the\nobligation may also include assumptions as to future compensation levels. For our other postretirement benefit plans, the obligation may include assumptions as to the expected cost\nof providing medical insurance benefits, as well as the extent to which those costs are shared with the employee or others (such as governmental programs). Plan assets are\nmeasured at fair value. Net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs other than the service costs are recognized in Other (income)/deductionsnet.\nS. Legal and Environmental Contingencies\nWe and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to numerous contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business, such as patent litigation, product liability and other product-related\nlitigation, commercial litigation, environmental claims and proceedings, government investigations and guarantees and indemnifications. In assessing contingencies related to legal\nand environmental proceedings that are pending against the Company, or unasserted claims that are probable of being asserted, we record accruals for these contingencies to the\nextent that we conclude that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable. If some amount within a range of loss appears to be a better estimate than any other amount within the\nrange, we accrue that amount. Alternatively, when no amount within a range of loss appears to be a better estimate than any other amount, we accrue the lowest amount in the range.\nWe record anticipated recoveries under existing insurance contracts when recovery is assured.\nT. Share-Based Payments\nOur compensation programs can include share-based payments. Generally, grants under share-based payment programs are accounted for at fair value and these fair values are\ngenerally amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting terms with the related costs recorded in Cost of sales, Selling, informational and administrative expenses and/or Research\nand development expenses, as appropriate.\nNote 2. Acquisitions, Divestitures, Equity-Method Investments, Licensing Arrangements and Collaborative Arrangements\nA. Acquisitions\nTrillium\nOn November 17, 2021, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding common stock not already owned by Pfizer of Trillium, a clinical stage immuno-oncology company developing\ntherapies targeting cancer immune evasion pathways and specific cell targeting approaches, for a price of $18.50 per share in cash, for total consideration of $2.0 billion, net of cash\nacquired. As a result, Trillium became our wholly owned subsidiary. We previously held a 2% ownership investment in Trillium. Trilliums lead program, TTI-622, is an investigational\nfusion protein that is designed to block the inhibitory activity of CD47, a molecule that is overexpressed by a wide variety of tumors.\nWe accounted for the transaction as an asset acquisition since the lead asset, TTI-622, represented substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired, which exclude cash\nacquired. At the acquisition date, we recorded a $2.1 billion charge representing an acquired IPR&D asset with no alternative future use in Research and development expenses, of\nwhich the $2.0 billion net cash consideration is presented as a cash outflow from operating activities. In connection with this acquisition, we recorded $256 million of assets acquired\nprimarily consisting of cash and investments. Liabilities assumed were approximately $81 million.\nArray\nOn July 30, 2019, we acquired Array, a commercial stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of targeted small molecule\nmedicines to treat cancer and other diseases of high unmet need, for $48 per share in cash. The total fair value of the consideration transferred was $11.2 billion ($10.9 billion, net of\ncash acquired). In addition, $157 million in payments to Array employees for the fair value of previously unvested stock options was recognized as post-closing compensation expense\nand recorded in Restructuring charges and certain acquisition-related costs (see Note 3). We financed the majority of the transaction with debt and the balance with existing cash.\nPfizer Inc.\n2021 Form 10-K\n64\n\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies\nArrays portfolio includes Braftovi (encorafenib) and Mektovi (binimetinib), a broad pipeline of targeted cancer medicines in different stages of R&D, as well as a portfolio of out-\nlicensed medicines, which may generate milestones and royalties over time.\nThe final allocation of the consideration transferred to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed was completed in 2020. In connection with this acquisition, we recorded: (i) $6.3\nbillion in Identifiable intangible assets, consisting of $2.0 billion of Developed technology rights with a useful life of 16 years, $2.8 billion of IPR&D and $1.5 billion of Licensing\nagreements and other ($1.2 billion for technology in developmentindefinite-lived licensing agreements and $360 million for developed technologyfinite-lived licensing agreements\nwith a useful life of 10 years), (ii) $6.1 billion of Goodwill, (iii) $1.1 billion of net deferred tax liabilities and (iv) $451 million of assumed long-term debt, which was paid in full in 2019.\nIn 2020, we recorded measurement period adjustments to the estimated fair values initially recorded in 2019, which resulted in a reduction in Identifiable intangible assets of\napproximately $900 million with a corresponding change to Goodwill and net deferred tax liabilities. The measurement period adjustments were recorded to better reflect market\nparticipant assumptions about facts and circumstances existing as of the acquisition date and did not have a material impact on our consolidated statement of income for the year\nended December 31, 2020.\nTherachon\nOn July 1, 2019, we acquired all the remaining shares of Therachon, a privately-held clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on rare diseases, with assets in development for\nthe treatment of achondroplasia, a genetic condition and the most common form of short-limb dwarfism, for $340 million upfront, plus potential milestone payments of up to $470\nmillion contingent on the achievement of key milestones in the development and commercialization of the lead asset. We accounted for the transaction as an asset acquisition since\nthe lead asset represented substantially all the fair value of the gross assets acquired. The total fair value of the consideration transferred for Therachon was $322 million, which\nconsisted of $317 million of cash and our previous $5 million investment in Therachon. In connection with this asset acquisition, we recorded a charge of $337 million in Research and\ndevelopment expenses.\nB. Divestitures\nMeridian\nOn December 31, 2021, we completed the sale of our Meridian subsidiary for approximately $51 million in cash and recognized a loss of approximately $167 million, net of tax, in\nDiscontinued operationsnet of tax. In connection with the sale, Pfizer and the purchaser of Meridian entered into various agreements to provide a framework for our relationship\nafter the sale, including interim TSAs and a manufacturing supply agreement (MSA). The TSAs primarily involve Pfizer providing services related to information technology, among\nother activities, and are generally expected to be for terms of no more than 12 to 18 months post sale. The MSA is for a term of three years post sale with a two year extension period.\nNo amounts were recorded under the above arrangements in 2021.\nUpjohn Separation and Combination with Mylan\nOn November 16, 2020, we completed the spin-off and the combination of the Upjohn Business with Mylan (the Transactions) to form Viatris.\nThe Transactions were structured as an all-stock, Reverse Morris Trust transaction. Specifically, (i) we contributed the Upjohn Business to a wholly owned subsidiary, which was\nrenamed Viatris, so that the Upjohn Business was separated from the remainder of our business (the Separation), (ii) following the Separation, we distributed, on a pro rata basis, all\nof the shares of Viatris common stock held by Pfizer to Pfizer stockholders as of the November 13, 2020 record date, such that each Pfizer stockholder as of the record date received\napproximately 0.124079 shares of Viatris common stock per share of Pfizer common stock (the Distribution); and (iii) immediately after the Distribution, the Upjohn Business combined\nwith Mylan in a series of transactions in which Mylan shareholders received one share of Viatris common stock for each Mylan ordinary share held by such shareholder, subject to any\napplicable withholding taxes (the Combination). Prior to the Distribution, Viatris made a cash payment to Pfizer equal to $12.0 billion as partial consideration for the contribution of the\nUpjohn Business to Viatris. As of the closing of the Combination, Pfizer stockholders owned approximately 57% of the outstanding shares of Viatris common stock, and Mylan\nshareholders owned approximately 43% of the outstanding shares of Viatris common stock, in each case on a fully diluted, as-converted and as-exercised basis. The Transactions are\ngenerally expected to be tax free to Pfizer and Pfizer stockholders for U.S. tax purposes. Beginning November 16, 2020, Viatris operates both the Upjohn Business and Mylan as an\nindependent publicly traded company, which is traded under the symbol VTRS on the NASDAQ.\nIn connection with the Transactions, in June 2020, Upjohn Inc. and Upjohn Finance B.V. completed privately placed debt offerings of $7.45 billion and 3.60 billion aggregate principal\namounts, respectively, (approximately $11.4 billion) of senior unsecured notes and entered into other financing arrangements, including a $600 million delayed draw term loan\nagreement and a revolving credit facility agreement for up to $4.0 billion. Proceeds from the debt offerings and other financing arrangements were used to fund the $12.0 billion cash\ndistribution Viatris made to Pfizer prior to the Distribution. We used the cash distribution proceeds to pay down commercial paper borrowings and redeem the $1.15 billion aggregate\nprincipal amount outstanding of our 1.95% senior unsecured notes that were due in June 2021 and $342 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of our 5.80% senior\nunsecured notes that were due in August 2023, before the maturity date. Interest expense for the $11.4 billion in debt securities incurred during 2020 is included in Discontinued\noperationsnet of tax. Following the Separation and Combination of the Upjohn Business with Mylan, we are no longer the obligor or guarantor of any Upjohn debt or Upjohn\nfinancing arrangements.\nAs a result of the spin-off of the Upjohn Business, we distributed net assets of $1.6 billion as of November 16, 2020, which was reflected as a reduction to Retained earnings and\nreflects the change in accounting principle in the first quarter of 2021 to MTM Accounting. See Note 1C. Of this amount, $412 million represents cash transferred to the Upjohn\nBusiness, with the remainder considered a non-cash activity in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2020. The spin-off also resulted in a net\nincrease to Accumulated other comprehensive loss of $423 million for the derecognition of net gains on foreign currency translation adjustments of $397 million and prior service net\ncredits associated with benefit plans of $26 million, which were reclassified to Retained earnings.\nAs a result of the separation of Upjohn, we incurred separation-related costs of $434 million in 2020 and $83 million in 2019, which are included in Discontinued operationsnet of\ntax. These costs primarily relate to professional fees for regulatory filings and separation activities within finance, tax, legal and information system functions as well as investment\nbanking fees.\nPfizer Inc.\n2021 Form 10-K\n65\n [END OF FILING]",

We recognize allowances based on purchases and sales as a reduction of cost of sales when the associated \ninventory is sold. Allowances for advertising and placement are recognized as a reduction of cost of sales ratably over the corresponding performance period. \nFunds that are determined to be a reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs incurred to sell a vendors products are recorded as an offset to \nthe related expense within SG&A when incurred.\n \nAdvertising Costs\n \nAdvertising costs, which are included in SG&A, are expensed the first time the advertisement runs. Advertising costs consist primarily of digital advertisements. \nAdvertising expenses were $864 million, $915 million and $819 million in fiscal 2023, fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, respectively.\n \nStock-Based Compensation\n \nWe recognize stock-based compensation expense for the fair value of our stock-based compensation awards, which is determined based on the closing market \nprice of our stock at the date of grant for time-based and performance-based share awards, and Monte-Carlo simulation for market-based share awards. \nCompensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the period in which services are required, except for performance-based share awards that \nvest on a graded basis, in which case the expense is front-loaded or recognized on a graded-attribution basis. Forfeitures are expensed as incurred or upon \ntermination.\n \nComprehensive Income (Loss)\n \nComprehensive income (loss) is computed as net earnings plus certain other items that are recorded directly to shareholders equity.\n \n2. Acquisitions\n \nCurrent Health Ltd.\n \nIn fiscal 2022, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Current Health Ltd. (Current Health), a care-at-home technology platform, on November 2, 2021, for \nnet cash consideration of $389 million. The acquired assets included $351 million of goodwill that was assigned to our Best Buy Health reporting unit and was \ndeductible for income tax purposes. The acquisition is aligned with our focus in virtual care to enable people in their homes to connect seamlessly with their \nhealth care providers and is included in our Domestic reportable segment and Services revenue category. The acquisition was accounted for using the \nacquisition method of accounting for business combinations and was not material to the results of operations.\n \nTwo Peaks, LLC d/b/a Yardbird Furniture\n \nIn fiscal 2022, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Two Peaks, LLC d/b/a Yardbird Furniture (Yardbird), a direct-to-consumer outdoor furniture company, \non November 4, 2021, for net cash consideration of $79 million. The acquired assets included $47 million of goodwill that was assigned to our Best Buy Domestic \nreporting unit and was deductible for income tax purposes. The acquisition expands our assortment in categories like outdoor living, as more and more \nconsumers look to make over or upgrade their outdoor living spaces.

Charges incurred relate to employee termination benefits within our Domestic and \nInternational segments of $140 million and $5 million, respectively.

The consolidated multidistrict litigation captioned In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804) is\npending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. This multidistrict litigation presumptively includes hundreds of relevant federal court cases\nthat name the Company as a defendant. A significant number of similar cases that name the Company as a defendant in some capacity are pending in state\ncourts.\nIn addition, the Company has been named as a defendant in similar cases brought by certain state Attorneys General. The Company is defending itself against\nall such claims. Additionally, the Company has received subpoenas, CIDs, and/or other requests for information regarding opioids from state Attorneys General\nand insurance and other regulators of several U.S. jurisdictions. The Company has been cooperating with the government with respect to these subpoenas,\nCIDs, and other requests for information.\nIn November 2021, the Company was among the chain pharmacies found liable by a jury in a trial in federal court in Ohio; in August 2022, the court issued a\njudgment jointly against the three defendants in the amount of $651 million to be paid over 15 years, and also ordered certain injunctive relief. The Company is\nappealing the judgment and has not accrued a liability for this matter. In March 2022, CVS Health Corporation and CVS Pharmacy, Inc. entered into a\nsettlement agreement with the State of Florida to resolve claims related to opioid medications dating back more than a decade. Under the terms of the\nsettlement agreement, CVS Health Corporation settled all opioid claims against it and its subsidiaries by the State of Florida for $484 million, which is to be\npaid over a period of 18 years. During the three months ended March 31, 2022, the Company recorded a $484 million liability associated with this legal\nsettlement. In August 2022, CVS Pharmacy, Inc. entered into an agreement with the State of New Mexico to settle all opioid claims against it and its parents\nand subsidiaries by the State of New Mexico and participating subdivisions. In September 2022, CVS Pharmacy, Inc. entered into an agreement with the State\nof West Virginia to settle all opioid claims against it and its parents and subsidiaries by the State of West Virginia and participating subdivisions. Also in\nSeptember 2022, CVS Pharmacy, Inc. entered into an agreement with the Cherokee Nation to settle all opioid claims against it and its parents and subsidiaries\nby the Cherokee Nation.\nIn December 2022, the Company agreed to a formal settlement agreement, the financial amounts of which were agreed to in principle in October 2022, with a\nleadership group of a number of state Attorneys General and the Plaintiffs Executive Committee (PEC). The agreement would resolve substantially all\nopioid claims against Company entities by states and political subdivisions, but not private plaintiffs. The maximum amount payable by the Company under the\nsettlement would be approximately $4.3 billion in opioid remediation and $625 million in attorneys fees and costs and additional remediation. The amounts\nwould be payable over 10 years, beginning in 2023. The agreement also contains injunctive terms relating to the dispensing of opioid medications. The\nsettlement agreement is available at nationalopioidsettlement.com.\nUnder the settlement agreement, before the Company determines whether to enter into any final settlement, it will assess the number and identities of the\ngovernmental entities that will participate in any such settlement. The settlement agreement contemplates that if certain governmental entities do not agree to\nthe settlement, but the Company nonetheless concludes that there is sufficient participation to warrant going forward with the settlement, there would be a\ncorresponding reduction in the amount due from the Company to account for the governmental entities that did not agree. Those non-participating\ngovernmental entities would be entitled to pursue their claims against the Company and other defendants. Private plaintiff litigation will also continue.\nThe Company has been informed that 45 states, the District of Columbia, and all eligible United States territories have elected to join the settlement. Three\nstates were the subject of earlier settlements. The Company has elected to proceed with the settlement process based on that level of participation. The\nsettlement process will progress to the period during which subdivisions may elect to join.\nIn December 2022, the Company also agreed to a formal settlement agreement with a leadership group representing tribes throughout the United States. The\nagreement would resolve substantially all opioid claims against Company entities by such tribes. The maximum amount payable by the Company under the\nsettlement would be $113 million in opioid remediation and $18 million in attorneys fees and costs. The amounts would be payable over 10 years, beginning\nin 2023. The agreement is contingent upon sufficient participation by tribes.\n172\n [END OF FILING]",
