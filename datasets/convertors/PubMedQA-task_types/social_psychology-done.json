    "prompt": "Answer the question based on the following context: Stigmatizing attitudes toward people with disabilities can jeopardize such individuals' well-being and recovery through denial of employment and community isolation. By shaping social norms that define group membership, the construct of individualism may partially explain differences in stigmatizing attitudes across cultures. Further, widespread globalization has brought intensely individualistic social practices to certain segments of non-Western cultures. This paper examines whether the construct of individualism can help to explain cross-cultural differences in stigmatizing attitudes observed between American and Chinese employers. Employers (N = 879) from Beijing, Hong Kong, and Chicago provided information on their attitudes toward hiring people with disabilities, and path analyses were conducted to examine potential mediating relationships. Path analyses indicated that vertical individualism, along with perceived responsibility for acquiring a condition, partially mediated the relationship between culture and employers' negative attitudes about job candidates with disabilities.\nQuestion: Does individualism help explain differences in employers' stigmatizing attitudes toward disability across Chinese and American cities?",
    "expected_answer": "These results suggested that greater espousal of competitive and individualist values may drive stigmatizing attitudes across cultures.",

    "prompt": "Answer the question based on the following context: Studies show that stroke survivors typically have lower life satisfaction than persons who have not been diagnosed with stroke. To determine if significant differences in life satisfaction exist between stroke survivors with and without functional limitations and whether specific functional limitations, as well as participation in outpatient rehabilitation affect the odds of reported life satisfaction for stroke survivors. Chi square analysis was used to examine data from the 2013 BRFSS to determine the relationship of functional limitations as well as participation in rehabilitation services to life satisfaction for stroke survivors. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine what variables increased the odds of reported poor life satisfaction. Stroke survivors experiencing difficulty with cognition, depression and IADLs showed significantly lower life satisfaction than those who did not experience these functional limitations. Survivors exhibiting activity limitations had almost twice the odds of reporting poor life satisfaction and those experiencing limitations in cognition and IADLs had 2.88 times and 1.81 times the odds as others without these limitations of reporting poor life satisfaction, respectively. Participation in outpatient rehabilitation reduced the odds of reporting of poor life satisfaction by approximately one half.\nQuestion: Does type of disability and participation in rehabilitation affect satisfaction of stroke survivors?",
    "expected_answer": "Rehabilitation focused on addressing these functional limitations would increase life satisfaction for persons diagnosed with stroke. Future research on specific types of cognitive and daily living limitations would assist policy makers and referral sources in making appropriate referrals to rehabilitation.",

    "prompt": "Answer the question based on the following context: Several studies have reported higher prevalence of obesity in patients suffering from bipolar disorder (BD). To study the relation of elevated body mass index (BMI) in patients with BD more closely, we investigated differences in sociodemographic, clinical, and medical characteristics with respect to BMI, with the hypothesis that BMI is related to prognosis and outcome. We measured the BMI of 276 subjects of a tertiary care sample from the Maritime Bipolar Registry. Subjects were 16 to 83 years old, with psychiatric diagnoses of bipolar I disorder (n = 186), bipolar II disorder (n = 85), and BD not otherwise specified (n = 5). The registry included basic demographic data and details of the clinical presentation. We first examined the variables showing a significant association with BMI; subsequently, we modeled the relationship between BMI and psychiatric outcome using structural equation analysis. The prevalence of obesity in our sample was 39.1%. We found higher BMI in subjects with a chronic course (p<0.001) and longer duration of illness (p = 0.02), lower scores on the Global Assessment of Functioning Scale (p = 0.02), and on disability (p = 0.002). Overweight patients had more frequent comorbid subthreshold social (p = 0.02) and generalized anxiety disorders (p = 0.05), diabetes mellitus type II (p<0.001), and hypertension (p = 0.001). Subjects who achieved complete remission of symptoms on lithium showed significantly lower BMI (p = 0.01).\nQuestion: Can body mass index help predict outcome in patients with bipolar disorder?",
    "expected_answer": "Our findings suggest that BMI is associated with the prognosis and outcome of BD. Whether this association is causal remains to be determined.",

    "prompt": "Answer the question based on the following context: To investigate the discrepancies between outcomes for competence (can do) and actual performance (do do) in activities of daily living (ADLs). Baseline measurements of a population-based follow-up study. Leiden 85-Plus Study, the Netherlands. Five hundred and ninety-nine persons, age 85. The response rate was 86%. Face-to-face interviews. Measurements of competence and actual performance were based on the Groningen Activity Restriction Scale. Help received was assessed for several domains. Prevalence rates for disability were assessed according to the concepts of both competence and actual performance. Analysis was performed separately for basic activities of daily living (BADLs) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs). Seventy-seven percent of the oldest old were competent to perform all the BADLs and performed them regularly. Fifteen percent were not competent to perform certain BADLs independently but performed them regularly with help from others. The prevalence of disability defined as inability in one or more BADLs was 22% for women and 10% for men. The prevalence of disability defined as inactivity in one or more BADLs was 16% for women and 17% for men. Only 5% of the oldest old were competent to perform all IADLs and performed them regularly. In spite of being competent, 70% did not perform certain IADLs regularly. The prevalence of disability defined as inability in one or more IADLs was 64% for women and 55% for men. The prevalence of disability defined as inactivity in one or more IADLs was 92% for women and 98% for men.\nQuestion: Disability in the oldest old: \"can do\" or \"do do\"?",
    "expected_answer": "The structural discrepancies between the outcomes of competence and actual performance have important consequences when estimating disability in old people. Promoting actual performance in IADLs may reduce disability.",
