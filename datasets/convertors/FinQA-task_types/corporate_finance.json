how- ever , domestic cup and lid sales volumes were 5% ( 5 % ) lower than in 2004 as a result of a rationalization of our cus- tomer base early in 2005 . operating profits in 2005 in- creased 147% ( 147 % ) compared with 2004 , largely due to the settlement of a lawsuit and a favorable adjustment on the sale of the jackson , tennessee bag plant . excluding unusual items , operating profits were flat as improved price realizations offset increased costs for bleached board and resin . shorewood net sales of $ 691 million in 2005 were essentially flat with net sales in 2004 of $ 687 million , but were up compared with $ 665 million in 2003 . operating profits in 2005 were 17% ( 17 % ) above 2004 levels and about equal to 2003 levels . improved margins resulting from a rationalization of the customer mix and the effects of improved manufacturing operations , including the successful start up of our south korean tobacco operations , more than offset cost increases for board and paper and the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates in canada . beverage packaging net sales were $ 597 million in 2005 , $ 595 million in 2004 and $ 589 million in 2003 . average sale price realizations increased 2% ( 2 % ) compared with 2004 , principally the result of the pass-through of higher raw material costs , although the implementation of price increases continues to be impacted by com- petitive pressures . operating profits were down 14% ( 14 % ) compared with 2004 and 19% ( 19 % ) compared with 2003 , due principally to increases in board and resin costs . in 2006 , the bleached board market is expected to remain strong , with sales volumes increasing in the first quarter compared with the fourth quarter of 2005 for both folding carton and cup products . improved price realizations are also expected for bleached board and in our foodservice and beverage packaging businesses , al- though continued high costs for energy , wood and resin will continue to negatively impact earnings . shorewood should continue to benefit from strong asian operations and from targeted sales volume growth in 2006 . capital improvements and operational excellence initiatives undertaken in 2005 should benefit operating results in 2006 for all businesses . distribution our distribution business , principally represented by our xpedx business , markets a diverse array of products and supply chain services to customers in many business segments . customer demand is generally sensitive to changes in general economic conditions , although the . the sales of 2005 is $ 2590 ;

to higher average price realizations , reflecting announced price increases . product demand for the first quarter should be seasonally slow , but is ex- pected to strengthen as the year progresses , supported by continued economic growth in north america , asia and eastern europe . average prices should also improve in 2006 as price increases announced in late 2005 and early 2006 for uncoated freesheet paper and pulp con- tinue to be realized . operating rates are expected to improve as a result of industry-wide capacity reductions in 2005 . although energy and raw material costs remain high , there has been some decline in both natural gas and delivered wood costs , with further moderation ex- pected later in 2006 . we will continue to focus on fur- ther improvements in our global manufacturing operations , implementation of supply chain enhance- ments and reductions in overhead costs during 2006 . industrial packaging demand for industrial packaging products is closely correlated with non-durable industrial goods production in the united states , as well as with demand for proc- essed foods , poultry , meat and agricultural products . in addition to prices and volumes , major factors affecting the profitability of industrial packaging are raw material and energy costs , manufacturing efficiency and product industrial packaging 2019s net sales for 2005 increased 2% ( 2 % ) compared with 2004 , and were 18% ( 18 % ) higher than in 2003 , reflecting the inclusion of international paper distribution limited ( formerly international paper pacific millennium limited ) beginning in august 2005 . operating profits in 2005 were 39% ( 39 % ) lower than in 2004 and 13% ( 13 % ) lower than in 2003 . sales volume increases ( $ 24 million ) , improved price realizations ( $ 66 million ) , and strong mill operating performance ( $ 27 million ) were not enough to offset the effects of increased raw material costs ( $ 103 million ) , higher market related downtime costs ( $ 50 million ) , higher converting operating costs ( $ 22 million ) , and unfavorable mix and other costs ( $ 67 million ) . additionally , the may 2005 sale of our industrial papers business resulted in a $ 25 million lower earnings contribution from this business in 2005 . the segment took 370000 tons of downtime in 2005 , including 230000 tons of lack-of-order downtime

containerboard 2019s net sales totaled $ 895 million in 2005 , $ 951 million in 2004 and $ 815 million in 2003 . soft market conditions and declining customer demand at the end of the first quarter led to lower average sales prices during the second and third quarters . beginning in the fourth quarter , prices recovered as a result of in- creased customer demand and a rationalization of sup- ply . full year sales volumes trailed 2004 levels early in the year , reflecting the weak market conditions in the first half of 2005 . however , volumes rebounded in the second half of the year , and finished the year ahead of 2004 levels . operating profits decreased 38% ( 38 % ) from 2004 , but were flat with 2003 . the favorable impacts of in- creased sales volumes , higher average sales prices and improved mill operating performance were not enough to offset the impact of higher wood , energy and other raw material costs and increased lack-of-order down- time . implementation of the new supply chain operating model in our containerboard mills during 2005 resulted in increased operating efficiency and cost savings . specialty papers in 2005 included the kraft paper business for the

parcels for the years ended december 31 , 2004 and 2003 , respectively . as of december 31 , 2004 , only one parcel on which we recorded impairment charges is still owned by us . we anticipate selling

income by reportable segment to our total reported rental income from continuing operations for the years ended december 31 , 2003 and 2002 ( in thousands ) : . although our three reportable segments comprising rental operations ( office , industrial and retail ) are all within the real estate industry , they are not necessarily affected by the same economic and industry conditions . for example , our retail segment experienced high occupancies and strong overall performance during 2003 , while our office and industrial segments reflected the weaker economic environment for those property types . the primary causes of the increase in rental income from continuing operations , with specific references to a particular segment when applicable , are summarized below : 25cf during 2003 , in-service occupancy improved from 87.1% ( 87.1 % ) at the end of 2002 to 89.3% ( 89.3 % ) at the end of 2003 . the second half of 2003 was highlighted by a significant increase in the industrial portfolio occupancy of 2.1% ( 2.1 % ) along with a slight increase in office portfolio occupancy of 0.9% ( 0.9 % ) . 25cf lease termination fees totaled $ 27.4 million in 2002 compared to $ 16.2 million in 2003 . most of this decrease was attributable to the office segment , which recognized $ 21.1 million of termination fees in 2002 as compared to $ 11.8 million in 2003 . lease termination fees relate to specific tenants that pay a fee to terminate their lease obligations before the end of the contractual lease term . the high volume of termination fees in 2002 was reflective of the contraction of the business of large office users during that year and their desire to downsize their use of office space . the decrease in termination fees for 2003 was indicative of an improving

significantly less advanced than those in the united states , and initial voice networks continue to be deployed in underdeveloped areas . a majority of consumers in these markets still utilize basic wireless services , predominantly on feature phones , while advanced device penetration remains low . in more developed urban locations within these markets , early-stage data network deployments are underway . carriers are focused on completing voice network build-outs while also investing in initial data networks as wireless data usage and smartphone penetration within their customer bases begin to accelerate . in markets with rapidly evolving network technology , such as south africa and most of the countries in latin america where we do business , initial voice networks , for the most part , have already been built out , and carriers are focused on 3g and 4g network build outs . consumers in these regions are increasingly adopting smartphones and other advanced devices , and , as a result , the usage of bandwidth-intensive mobile applications is growing materially . recent spectrum auctions in these rapidly evolving markets have allowed incumbent carriers to accelerate their data network deployments and have also enabled new entrants to begin initial investments in data networks . smartphone penetration and wireless data usage in these markets are growing rapidly , which typically requires that carriers continue to invest in their networks in order to maintain and augment their quality of service . finally , in markets with more mature network technology , such as germany and france , carriers are focused on deploying 4g data networks to account for rapidly increasing wireless data usage among their customer base . with higher smartphone and advanced device penetration and significantly higher per capita data usage , carrier investment in networks is focused on 4g coverage and capacity . we believe that the network technology migration we have seen in the united states , which has led to significantly denser networks and meaningful new business commencements for us over a number of years , will ultimately be replicated in our less advanced international markets . as a result , we expect to be able to leverage our extensive international portfolio of approximately 104470 communications sites and the relationships we have built with our carrier customers to drive sustainable , long-term growth . we have master lease agreements with certain of our tenants that provide for consistent , long-term revenue and reduce the likelihood of churn . our master lease agreements build and augment strong strategic partnerships with our tenants and have significantly reduced colocation cycle times , thereby providing our tenants with the ability to rapidly and efficiently deploy equipment on our sites . property operations new site revenue growth . during the year ended december 31 , 2016 , we grew our portfolio of communications real estate through the acquisition and construction of approximately 45310 sites . in a majority of our asia , emea and latin america markets , the revenue generated from newly acquired or constructed sites resulted in increases in both tenant and pass-through revenues ( such as ground rent or power and fuel costs ) and expenses . we continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire communications real estate portfolios , both domestically and internationally , to determine whether they meet our risk-adjusted hurdle rates and whether we believe we can effectively integrate them into our existing portfolio. . property operations expenses . direct operating expenses incurred by our property segments include direct site level expenses and consist primarily of ground rent and power and fuel costs , some or all of which may be passed through to our tenants , as well as property taxes , repairs and maintenance . these segment direct operating expenses exclude all segment and corporate selling , general , administrative and development expenses , which are aggregated into one line item entitled selling , general , administrative and development expense in our consolidated statements of operations . in general , our property segments 2019 selling , general , administrative and development expenses do not significantly increase as a result of adding incremental tenants to our sites and typically increase only modestly year-over-year . as a result , leasing additional space to new tenants on our sites provides significant incremental cash flow . we may , however , incur additional segment selling , general , administrative and development expenses as we increase our presence in our existing markets or expand into new markets . our profit margin growth is therefore positively impacted by the addition of new tenants to our sites but can be temporarily diluted by our development activities. . the u.s . of 2016 is 65 ; the u.s . of 2015 is 11595 ; the u.s . of 2014

strategy is to contract most of its physical guarantee , as described in regulatory framework section below , and sell the remaining portion in the spot market . tiet ea's strategy is reassessed from time to time according to changes in market conditions , hydrology and other factors . tiet ea has been continuously selling its available energy from 2016 forward through medium-term bilateral contracts of three to five years . as of december 31 , 2016 , tiet ea's contracted portfolio position is 95% ( 95 % ) and 88% ( 88 % ) with average prices of r$ 157/ mwh and r$ 159/mwh ( inflation adjusted until december 2016 ) for 2016 and 2017 , respectively . as brazil is mostly a hydro-based country with energy prices highly tied to the hydrological situation , the deterioration of the hydrology since the beginning of 2014 caused an increase in energy prices going forward . tiet ea is closely monitoring and analyzing system supply conditions to support energy commercialization decisions . under the concession agreement , tiet ea has an obligation to increase its capacity by 15% ( 15 % ) . tiet ea , as well as other concession generators , have not yet met this requirement due to regulatory , environmental , hydrological and fuel constraints . the state of s e3o paulo does not have a sufficient potential for wind power and only has a small remaining potential for hydro projects . as such , the capacity increases in the state will mostly be derived from thermal gas capacity projects . due to the highly complex process to obtain an environmental license for coal projects , tiet ea decided to fulfill its obligation with gas-fired projects in line with the federal government plans . petrobras refuses to supply natural gas and to offer capacity in its pipelines and regasification terminals . therefore , there are no regulations for natural gas swaps in place , and it is unfeasible to bring natural gas to aes tiet ea . a legal case has been initiated by the state of s e3o paulo requiring the investment to be performed . tiet ea is in the process of analyzing options to meet the obligation . uruguaiana is a 640 mw gas-fired combined cycle power plant located in the town of uruguaiana in the state of rio grande do sul , commissioned in december 2000 . aes manages and has a 46% ( 46 % ) economic interest in the plant with the remaining interest held by bndes . the plant's operations were suspended in april 2009 due to the unavailability of gas . aes has evaluated several alternatives to bring gas supply on a competitive basis to uruguaiana . one of the challenges is the capacity restrictions on the argentinean pipeline , especially during the winter season when gas demand in argentina is very high . the plant operated on a short-term basis during february and march 2013 , march through may 2014 , and february through may 2015 due to the short-term supply of lng for the facility . the plant did not operate in 2016 . uruguaiana continues to work toward securing gas on a long-term basis . market structure 2014 brazil has installed capacity of 150136 mw , which is 65% ( 65 % ) hydroelectric , 19% ( 19 % ) thermal and 16% ( 16 % ) renewable ( biomass and wind ) . brazil's national grid is divided into four subsystems . tiet ea is in the southeast and uruguaiana is in the south subsystems of the national grid . regulatory framework 2014 in brazil , the ministry of mines and energy determines the maximum amount of energy that a plant can sell , called physical guarantee , which represents the long-term average expected energy production of the plant . under current rules , physical guarantee can be sold to distribution companies through long- term regulated auctions or under unregulated bilateral contracts with large consumers or energy trading companies . the national system operator ( \"ons\" ) is responsible for coordinating and controlling the operation of the national grid . the ons dispatches generators based on hydrological conditions , reservoir levels , electricity demand and the prices of fuel and thermal generation . given the importance of hydro generation in the country , the ons sometimes reduces dispatch of hydro facilities and increases dispatch of thermal facilities to protect reservoir levels in the system . in brazil , the system operator controls all hydroelectric generation dispatch and reservoir levels . a mechanism known as the energy reallocation mechanism ( \"mre\" ) was created to share hydrological risk across mre hydro generators . if the hydro plants generate less than the total mre physical guarantee , the hydro generators may need to purchase energy in the short-term market to fulfill their contract obligations . when total hydro generation is higher than the total mre physical guarantee , the surplus is proportionally shared among its participants and they are able to make extra revenue selling the excess energy on the spot market . the consequences of unfavorable hydrology are ( i ) thermal plants more expensive to the system being dispatched , ( ii ) lower hydropower generation with deficits in the mre and ( iii ) high spot prices . aneel defines the spot price cap for electricity in the brazilian market . the spot price caps as defined by aneel and average spot prices by calendar year are as follows ( r$ / . . the spot price cap as defined by aneel of 2017 is 534 ; the spot price cap as defined by aneel of 2016 is 423 ; the spot price cap as defined by aneel of 2015 is 388 ; the spot price cap as defined by aneel of 2014

december 31 , 2002 space systems space systems 2019 operating results included the following : ( in millions ) 2002 2001 2000 . net sales for space systems increased by 8% ( 8 % ) in 2002 compared to 2001 . the increase in sales for 2002 resulted from higher volume in government space of $ 370 million and commercial space of $ 180 million . in government space , increases of $ 470 million in government satellite programs and $ 130 million in ground systems activities more than offset volume declines of $ 175 million on government launch vehi- cles and $ 55 million on strategic missile programs . the increase in commercial space sales is primarily attributable to an increase in launch vehicle activities , with nine commercial launches during 2002 compared to six in 2001 . net sales for the segment decreased by 7% ( 7 % ) in 2001 com- pared to 2000 . the decrease in sales for 2001 resulted from volume declines in commercial space of $ 560 million , which more than offset increases in government space of $ 60 million . in commercial space , sales declined due to volume reductions of $ 480 million in commercial launch vehicle activities and $ 80 million in satellite programs . there were six launches in 2001 compared to 14 launches in 2000 . the increase in gov- ernment space resulted from a combined increase of $ 230 mil- lion related to higher volume on government satellite programs and ground systems activities . these increases were partially offset by a $ 110 million decrease related to volume declines in government launch vehicle activity , primarily due to program maturities , and by $ 50 million due to the absence in 2001 of favorable adjustments recorded on the titan iv pro- gram in 2000 . operating profit for the segment increased 23% ( 23 % ) in 2002 as compared to 2001 , mainly driven by the commercial space business . reduced losses in commercial space during 2002 resulted in increased operating profit of $ 90 million when compared to 2001 . commercial satellite manufacturing losses declined $ 100 million in 2002 as operating performance improved and satellite deliveries increased . in the first quarter of 2001 , a $ 40 million loss provision was recorded on certain commercial satellite manufacturing contracts . due to the industry-wide oversupply and deterioration of pricing in the commercial launch market , financial results on commercial launch vehicles continue to be challenging . during 2002 , this trend led to a decline in operating profit of $ 10 million on commercial launch vehicles when compared to 2001 . this decrease was primarily due to lower profitability of $ 55 mil- lion on the three additional launches in the current year , addi- tional charges of $ 60 million ( net of a favorable contract adjustment of $ 20 million ) for market and pricing pressures and included the adverse effect of a $ 35 million adjustment for commercial launch vehicle contract settlement costs . the 2001 results also included charges for market and pricing pressures , which reduced that year 2019s operating profit by $ 145 million . the $ 10 million decrease in government space 2019s operating profit for the year is primarily due to the reduced volume on government launch vehicles and strategic missile programs , which combined to decrease operating profit by $ 80 million , partially offset by increases of $ 40 million in government satellite programs and $ 30 million in ground systems activities . operating profit for the segment increased by 4% ( 4 % ) in 2001 compared to 2000 . operating profit increased in 2001 due to a $ 35 million increase in government space partially offset by higher year-over-year losses of $ 20 million in commercial space . in government space , operating profit increased due to the impact of higher volume and improved performance in ground systems and government satellite programs . the year- to-year comparison of operating profit was not affected by the $ 50 million favorable titan iv adjustment recorded in 2000 discussed above , due to a $ 55 million charge related to a more conservative assessment of government launch vehi- cle programs that was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2000 . in commercial space , decreased operating profit of $ 15 mil- lion on launch vehicles more than offset lower losses on satel- lite manufacturing activities . the commercial launch vehicle operating results included $ 60 million in higher charges for market and pricing pressures when compared to 2000 . these negative adjustments were partially offset by $ 50 million of favorable contract adjustments on certain launch vehicle con- tracts . commercial satellite manufacturing losses decreased slightly from 2000 and included the adverse impact of a $ 40 million loss provision recorded in the first quarter of 2001 for certain commercial satellite contracts related to schedule and technical issues. . the net sales of 2002 is $ 7384 ; the net sales of 2001 is $ 6836 ; the net sales of 2000 is $ 7339 ;the operating profit of 2002 is 443 ; the operating profit of 2001 is 360 ; the operating profit of 2000 is 345 ;",

we pursue opportunities to dispose of land in markets with a high concentration of undeveloped land and in those markets where the land no longer meets our strategic development plans . the increase was partially attributable to a land sale to a current corporate tenant for potential future expansion . we recorded $ 424000 and $ 560000 of impairment charges associated with contracts to sell land parcels for the years ended december 31 , 2004 and 2003 , respectively . as of december 31 , 2004 , only one parcel on which we recorded impairment charges is still owned by us . we anticipate selling this parcel in the first quarter of 2005 . discontinued operations we have classified operations of 86 buildings as discontinued operations as of december 31 , 2004 . these 86 buildings consist of 69 industrial , 12 office and five retail properties . as a result , we classified net income from operations , net of minority interest , of $ 1.6 million , $ 6.3 million and $ 10.7 million as net income from discontinued operations for the years ended december 31 , 2004 , 2003 and 2002 , respectively . in addition , 41 of the properties classified in discontinued operations were sold during 2004 , 42 properties were sold during 2003 , two properties were sold during 2002 and one operating property is classified as held-for-sale at december 31 , 2004 . the gains on disposal of these properties , net of impairment adjustment and minority interest , of $ 23.9 million and $ 11.8 million for the years ended december 31 , 2004 and 2003 , respectively , are also reported in discontinued operations . for the year ended december 31 , 2002 , a $ 4.5 million loss on disposal of properties , net of impairment adjustments and minority interest , is reported in discontinued operations due to impairment charges of $ 7.7 million recorded on three properties in 2002 that were later sold in 2003 and 2004 . comparison of year ended december 31 , 2003 to year ended december 31 , 2002 rental income from continuing operations rental income from continuing operations increased from $ 652.8 million in 2002 to $ 689.3 million in 2003 . the following table reconciles rental income by reportable segment to our total reported rental income from continuing operations for the years ended december 31 , 2003 and 2002 ( in thousands ) : . although our three reportable segments comprising rental operations ( office , industrial and retail ) are all within the real estate industry , they are not necessarily affected by the same economic and industry conditions . for example , our retail segment experienced high occupancies and strong overall performance during 2003 , while our office and industrial segments reflected the weaker economic environment for those property types . the primary causes of the increase in rental income from continuing operations , with specific references to a particular segment when applicable , are summarized below : 25cf during 2003 , in-service occupancy improved from 87.1% ( 87.1 % ) at the end of 2002 to 89.3% ( 89.3 % ) at the end of 2003 . the second half of 2003 was highlighted by a significant increase in the industrial portfolio occupancy of 2.1% ( 2.1 % ) along with a slight increase in office portfolio occupancy of 0.9% ( 0.9 % ) . 25cf lease termination fees totaled $ 27.4 million in 2002 compared to $ 16.2 million in 2003 . most of this decrease was attributable to the office segment , which recognized $ 21.1 million of termination fees in 2002 as compared to $ 11.8 million in 2003 . lease termination fees relate to specific tenants that pay a fee to terminate their lease obligations before the end of the contractual lease term . the high volume of termination fees in 2002 was reflective of the contraction of the business of large office users during that year and their desire to downsize their use of office space . the decrease in termination fees for 2003 was indicative of an improving economy and a more stable financial position of our tenants . 25cf during the year ended 2003 , we acquired $ 232 million of properties totaling 2.1 million square feet . the acquisitions were primarily class a office buildings in existing markets with overall occupancy near 90% ( 90 % ) . revenues associated with these acquisitions totaled $ 11.9 million in 2003 . in addition , revenues from 2002 acquisitions totaled $ 15.8 million in 2003 compared to $ 4.8 million in 2002 . this significant increase is primarily due to a large office acquisition that closed at the end of december 2002 . 25cf developments placed in-service in 2003 provided revenues of $ 6.6 million , while revenues associated with developments placed in-service in 2002 totaled $ 13.7 million in 2003 compared to $ 4.7 million in 25cf proceeds from dispositions of held for rental properties totaled $ 126.1 million in 2003 , compared to $ 40.9 million in 2002 . these properties generated revenue of $ 12.5 million in 2003 versus $ 19.6 million in 2002 . equity in earnings of unconsolidated companies equity in earnings represents our ownership share of net income from investments in unconsolidated companies . these joint ventures generally own and operate rental properties and hold land for development . these earnings decreased from $ 27.2 million in 2002 to $ 23.7 million in 2003 . this decrease is a result of the following significant activity: . the office of 2003 is $ 419962 ; the office of 2002 is $ 393810 ;the industrial of 2003 is 259762 ; the industrial of 2002 is 250391 ;the

including and excluding costs associated with signing an agree- ment to acquire temple-inland ) in 2011 and $ 763 million ( $ 776 million excluding facility closure costs ) in 2010 . sales volumes for the legacy business were about flat in 2012 compared with 2011 . average sales price was lower mainly due to export containerboard sales prices which bottomed out in the first quarter but climbed steadily the rest of the year . input costs were lower for recycled fiber , wood and natural gas , but higher for starch . freight costs also increased . plan- ned maintenance downtime costs were higher than in 2011 . operating costs were higher largely due to routine inventory valuation adjustments operating profits in 2012 benefited from $ 235 million of temple-inland synergies . market-related downtime in 2012 was about 570000 tons compared with about 380000 tons in 2011 . operating profits in 2012 included $ 184 million of costs associated with the acquisition and integration of temple-inland and $ 91 million of costs associated with the divestiture of three containerboard mills . operating profits in 2011 included charges of $ 20 million for costs associated with the signing of the agreement to acquire temple- inland . looking ahead to 2013 , sales volumes in the first quarter compared with the fourth quarter of 2012 are expected to increase slightly for boxes due to a higher number of shipping days . average sales price realizations are expected to reflect the pass-through to box customers of a containerboard price increase implemented in 2012 . input costs are expected to be higher for recycled fiber , wood and starch . planned maintenance downtime costs are expected to be about $ 26 million higher with outages scheduled at eight mills compared with six mills in the 2012 fourth quarter . manufacturing operating costs are expected to be lower . european industr ia l packaging net sales were $ 1.0 billion in 2012 compared with $ 1.1

economic environment in southern europe . demand for pack- aging in the agricultural markets was about flat year- over-year . average sales margins increased due to sales price increases implemented during 2011 and 2012 and lower board costs . other input costs were higher , primarily for energy and distribution . operat- ing profits in 2012 included a net gain of $ 10 million for an insurance settlement , partially offset by addi- tional operating costs , related to the earthquakes in northern italy in may which affected our san felice box plant . entering the first quarter of 2013 , sales volumes are expected to be stable reflecting a seasonal decrease in market demand in agricultural markets offset by an increase in industrial markets . average sales margins are expected to improve

impacted by higher average sales margins in 2012 compared with 2011 , but this benefit was offset by lower sales volumes and higher raw material costs and operating costs . looking ahead to the first quarter of 2013 , sales volumes and average sales margins are expected to decrease due to seasonality . net sales for the distribution operations were $ 260 million in 2012 compared with $ 285 million

16285.1 million for fiscal 2018 increased $ 1425.4 million , or 9.6% ( 9.6 % ) , compared to fiscal 2017 . the increase was primarily a result of an increase in corrugated packaging segment sales , driven by higher selling price/mix and the contributions from acquisitions , and increased consumer packaging segment sales , primarily due to the contribution from acquisitions ( primarily the mps acquisition ) . these increases were partially offset by the absence of net sales from hh&b in fiscal 2018 due to the sale of hh&b in april 2017 and lower land and development segment sales compared to the prior year period due to the timing of real estate sales as we monetize the portfolio and lower merchandising display sales in the consumer packaging segment . segment income increased $ 491.5 million in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 , primarily due to increased corrugated packaging segment income . with respect to segment income , we experienced higher levels of cost inflation during fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017 , which was partially offset by recycled fiber deflation . the primary inflationary items were freight costs , chemical costs , virgin fiber costs and wage and other costs . productivity improvements in fiscal 2018 more than offset the net impact of cost inflation . while it is difficult to predict specific inflationary items , we expect higher cost inflation to continue through fiscal 2019 . our corrugated packaging segment increased its net sales by $ 695.1 million in fiscal 2018 to $ 9103.4 million from $ 8408.3 million in fiscal 2017 . the increase in net sales was primarily due to higher corrugated selling price/mix and higher corrugated volumes ( including acquisitions ) , which were partially offset by lower net sales from recycling operations due to lower recycled fiber costs , lower sales related to the deconsolidation of a foreign joint venture in fiscal 2017 and the impact of foreign currency . north american box shipments increased 4.1% ( 4.1 % ) on a per day basis in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 . segment income attributable to the corrugated packaging segment in fiscal 2018 increased $ 454.0 million to $ 1207.9 million compared to $ 753.9 million in fiscal 2017 . the increase was primarily due to higher selling price/mix , lower recycled fiber costs and productivity improvements which were partially offset by higher levels of cost inflation and other items , including increased depreciation and amortization . our consumer packaging segment increased its net sales by $ 838.9 million in fiscal 2018 to $ 7291.4 million from $ 6452.5 million in fiscal 2017 . the increase in net sales was primarily due to an increase in net sales from acquisitions ( primarily the mps acquisition ) and higher

from sales of undeveloped land owned by us . we pursue opportunities to dispose of land in markets with a high concentration of undeveloped land and in those markets where the land no longer meets our strategic development plans . the increase was partially attributable to a land sale to a current corporate tenant for potential future expansion . we recorded $ 424000 and $ 560000 of impairment charges associated with contracts to sell land parcels for the years ended december 31 , 2004 and 2003 , respectively . as of december 31 , 2004 , only one parcel on which we recorded impairment charges is still owned by us . we anticipate selling this parcel in the first quarter of 2005 . discontinued operations we have classified operations of 86 buildings as discontinued operations as of december 31 , 2004 . these 86 buildings consist of 69 industrial , 12 office and five retail properties . as a result , we classified net income from operations , net of minority interest , of $ 1.6 million , $ 6.3 million and $ 10.7 million as net income from discontinued operations for the years ended december 31 , 2004 , 2003 and 2002 , respectively . in addition , 41 of the properties

december 31 , 2003 to year ended december 31 , 2002 rental income from continuing operations rental income from continuing operations increased from $ 652.8 million in 2002 to $ 689.3 million in 2003 . the following table reconciles rental income by reportable segment to our total reported rental income from continuing operations for the years ended december 31 , 2003 and 2002 ( in thousands ) : . although our three reportable segments comprising rental operations ( office , industrial and retail ) are all within the real estate industry , they are not necessarily affected by the same economic and industry conditions . for example , our retail segment experienced high occupancies and strong overall performance during 2003 , while our office and industrial segments reflected the weaker economic environment for those property types . the primary causes of the increase in rental income from continuing operations , with specific references to a particular segment when applicable , are summarized below : 25cf during 2003 , in-service occupancy improved from 87.1% ( 87.1 % ) at the end of 2002 to 89.3% ( 89.3 % ) at the end of 2003 . the second half of 2003 was highlighted by a significant increase in the industrial portfolio occupancy of 2.1% ( 2.1 % ) along with a slight increase in office portfolio occupancy of 0.9% ( 0.9 % ) . 25cf lease termination fees totaled $ 27.4 million in 2002 compared to $ 16.2 million in 2003 . most of this decrease was attributable to the office segment , which recognized $ 21.1 million of termination fees in 2002 as compared to $ 11.8 million in 2003 . lease termination fees relate to specific tenants that pay a fee to terminate their lease obligations before the end of the contractual lease term . the high volume of termination fees in 2002 was reflective of the contraction of the business of large office users during that year and their desire to downsize their use of office space . the decrease in termination fees for 2003 was indicative of an improving economy and a more stable financial position of our tenants . 25cf during the year ended 2003 , we acquired $ 232 million of properties totaling 2.1 million square feet . the acquisitions were primarily class a office buildings in existing markets with overall occupancy near 90% ( 90 % ) . revenues associated with these acquisitions totaled $ 11.9 million in 2003 . in addition , revenues from 2002 acquisitions totaled $ 15.8 million in 2003 compared to $ 4.8 million in 2002 . this significant increase is primarily due to a large office acquisition that closed at the end of december 2002 . 25cf developments placed in-service in 2003 provided revenues of $ 6.6 million , while revenues associated with developments placed in-service in 2002 totaled $ 13.7 million in 2003 compared to $ 4.7 million in 25cf proceeds from dispositions of held for rental properties totaled $ 126.1 million in 2003 , compared to $ 40.9 million in 2002 . these properties generated revenue of $ 12.5 million in 2003 versus $ 19.6 million in 2002 . equity in earnings of unconsolidated companies equity in earnings represents our ownership share of net income from investments in unconsolidated companies . these joint ventures generally own and operate rental properties and hold land for development . these earnings decreased from $ 27.2 million in 2002 to $ 23.7 million in 2003 . this decrease is a result of the following significant activity: . the office of 2003 is $ 419962 ; the office of 2002 is $ 393810 ;the industrial of 2003 is 259762 ; the industrial of 2002 is
