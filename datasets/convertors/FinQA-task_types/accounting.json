. and sl green operating partnership , l.p . notes to consolidated financial statements ( cont. ) december 31 , 2018 pricing models , replacement cost , and termination cost are used to determine fair value . all methods of assessing fair value result in a general approximation of value , and such value may never actually be realized . in the normal course of business , we are exposed to the effect of interest rate changes and limit these risks by following established risk management policies and procedures including the use of derivatives . to address exposure to interest rates , derivatives are used primarily to fix the rate on debt based on floating-rate indices and manage the cost of borrowing obligations . we use a variety of conventional derivative products . these derivatives typically include interest rate swaps , caps , collars and floors . we expressly prohibit the use of unconventional derivative instruments and using derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes . further , we have a policy of only entering into contracts with major financial institutions based upon their credit ratings and other factors . we may employ swaps , forwards or purchased options to hedge qualifying forecasted transactions . gains and losses related to these transactions are deferred and recognized in net income as interest expense in the same period or periods that the underlying transaction occurs , expires or is otherwise terminated . hedges that are reported at fair value and presented on the balance sheet could be characterized as cash flow hedges or fair value hedges . interest rate caps and collars are examples of cash flow hedges . cash flow hedges address the risk associated with future cash flows of interest payments . for all hedges held by us and which were deemed to be fully effective in meeting the hedging objectives established by our corporate policy governing interest rate risk management , no net gains or losses were reported in earnings . the changes in fair value of hedge instruments are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income . for derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments , the gain or loss , resulting from the change in the estimated fair value of the derivative instruments , is recognized in current earnings during the period of change . earnings per share of the company the company presents both basic and diluted earnings per share , or eps , using the two-class method , which is an earnings allocation formula that determines eps for common stock and any participating securities according to dividends declared ( whether paid or unpaid ) . under the two-class method , basic eps is computed by dividing the income available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common stock shares outstanding for the period . basic eps includes participating securities , consisting of unvested restricted stock that receive nonforfeitable dividends similar to shares of common stock . diluted eps reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock , where such exercise or conversion would result in a lower eps amount . diluted eps also includes units of limited partnership interest . the dilutive effect of stock options is reflected in the weighted average diluted outstanding shares calculation by application of the treasury stock method . there was no dilutive effect for the exchangeable senior notes as the conversion premium was to be paid in cash . earnings per unit of the operating partnership the operating partnership presents both basic and diluted earnings per unit , or epu , using the two-class method , which is an earnings allocation formula that determines epu for common units and any participating securities according to dividends declared ( whether paid or unpaid ) . under the two-class method , basic epu is computed by dividing the income available to common unitholders by the weighted-average number of common units outstanding for the period . basic epu includes participating securities , consisting of unvested restricted units that receive nonforfeitable dividends similar to shares of common units . diluted epu reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common units were exercised or converted into common units , where such exercise or conversion would result in a lower epu amount . the dilutive effect of unit options is reflected in the weighted average diluted outstanding units calculation by application of the treasury stock method . there was no dilutive effect for the exchangeable senior notes as the conversion premium was to be paid in cash . use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes . actual results could differ from those estimates . concentrations of credit risk financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash investments , debt and preferred equity investments and accounts receivable . we place our cash investments with high quality financial
