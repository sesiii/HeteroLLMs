conditions , among other factors . pullmantur is a brand targeted primarily at the spanish , portu- guese and latin american markets and although pullmantur has diversified its passenger sourcing over the past few years , spain still represents pullmantur 2019s largest market . as previously disclosed , during 2012 european economies continued to demonstrate insta- bility in light of heightened concerns over sovereign debt issues as well as the impact of proposed auster- ity measures on certain markets . the spanish econ- omy was more severely impacted than many other economies and there is significant uncertainty as to when it will recover . in addition , the impact of the costa concordia incident has had a more lingering effect than expected and the impact in future years is uncertain . these factors were identified in the past as significant risks which could lead to the impairment of pullmantur 2019s goodwill . more recently , the spanish economy has progressively worsened and forecasts suggest the challenging operating environment will continue for an extended period of time . the unemployment rate in spain reached 26% ( 26 % ) during the fourth quarter of 2012 and is expected to rise further in 2013 . the international monetary fund , which had projected gdp growth of 1.8% ( 1.8 % ) a year ago , revised its 2013 gdp projections downward for spain to a contraction of 1.3% ( 1.3 % ) during the fourth quarter of 2012 and further reduced it to a contraction of 1.5% ( 1.5 % ) in january of 2013 . during the latter half of 2012 new austerity measures , such as increases to the value added tax , cuts to benefits , the phasing out of exemptions and the suspension of government bonuses , were implemented by the spanish government . we believe these austerity measures are having a larger impact on consumer confidence and discretionary spending than previously anticipated . as a result , there has been a significant deterioration in bookings from guests sourced from spain during the 2013 wave season . the combination of all of these factors has caused us to negatively adjust our cash flow projections , especially our closer-in net yield assumptions and the expectations regarding future capacity growth for the brand . based on our updated cash flow projections , we determined the implied fair value of goodwill for the pullmantur reporting unit was $ 145.5 million and rec- ognized an impairment charge of $ 319.2 million . this impairment charge was recognized in earnings during the fourth quarter of 2012 and is reported within impairment of pullmantur related assets within our consolidated statements of comprehensive income ( loss ) . there have been no goodwill impairment charges related to the pullmantur reporting unit in prior periods . see note 13 . fair value measurements and derivative instruments for further discussion . if the spanish economy weakens further or recovers more slowly than contemplated or if the economies of other markets ( e.g . france , brazil , latin america ) perform worse than contemplated in our discounted cash flow model , or if there are material changes to the projected future cash flows used in the impair- ment analyses , especially in net yields , an additional impairment charge of the pullmantur reporting unit 2019s goodwill may be required . note 4 . intangible assets intangible assets are reported in other assets in our consolidated balance sheets and consist of the follow- ing ( in thousands ) : . during the fourth quarter of 2012 , we performed the annual impairment review of our trademarks and trade names using a discounted cash flow model and the relief-from-royalty method . the royalty rate used is based on comparable royalty agreements in the tourism and hospitality industry . these trademarks and trade names relate to pullmantur and we have used a discount rate comparable to the rate used in valuing the pullmantur reporting unit in our goodwill impairment test . as described in note 3 . goodwill , the continued deterioration of the spanish economy caused us to negatively adjust our cash flow projections for the pullmantur reporting unit , especially our closer-in net yield assumptions and the timing of future capacity growth for the brand . based on our updated cash flow projections , we determined that the fair value of pullmantur 2019s trademarks and trade names no longer exceeded their carrying value . accordingly , we recog- nized an impairment charge of approximately $ 17.4 million to write down trademarks and trade names to their fair value of $ 204.9 million . this impairment charge was recognized in earnings during the fourth quarter of 2012 and is reported within impairment of pullmantur related assets within our consolidated statements of comprehensive income ( loss ) . see note 13 . fair value measurements and derivative instruments for further discussion . if the spanish economy weakens further or recovers more slowly

    "prompt": "what was the total collateral of all types december 31 , 2009?\njpmorgan chase & co./2009 annual report 181 the following table shows the current credit risk of derivative receivables after netting adjustments , and the current liquidity risk of derivative payables after netting adjustments , as of december 31 , 2009. . in addition to the collateral amounts reflected in the table above , at december 31 , 2009 , the firm had received and posted liquid secu- rities collateral in the amount of $ 15.5 billion and $ 11.7 billion , respectively . the firm also receives and delivers collateral at the initiation of derivative transactions , which is available as security against potential exposure that could arise should the fair value of the transactions move in the firm 2019s or client 2019s favor , respectively . furthermore , the firm and its counterparties hold collateral related to contracts that have a non-daily call frequency for collateral to be posted , and collateral that the firm or a counterparty has agreed to return but has not yet settled as of the reporting date . at december 31 , 2009 , the firm had received $ 16.9 billion and delivered $ 5.8 billion of such additional collateral . these amounts were not netted against the derivative receivables and payables in the table above , because , at an individual counterparty level , the collateral exceeded the fair value exposure at december 31 , 2009 . credit derivatives credit derivatives are financial instruments whose value is derived from the credit risk associated with the debt of a third-party issuer ( the reference entity ) and which allow one party ( the protection purchaser ) to transfer that risk to another party ( the protection seller ) . credit derivatives expose the protection purchaser to the creditworthiness of the protection seller , as the protection seller is required to make payments under the contract when the reference entity experiences a credit event , such as a bankruptcy , a failure to pay its obligation or a restructuring . the seller of credit protection receives a premium for providing protection but has the risk that the underlying instrument referenced in the contract will be subject to a credit event . the firm is both a purchaser and seller of protection in the credit derivatives market and uses these derivatives for two primary purposes . first , in its capacity as a market-maker in the dealer/client business , the firm actively risk manages a portfolio of credit derivatives by purchasing and selling credit protection , pre- dominantly on corporate debt obligations , to meet the needs of customers . as a seller of protection , the firm 2019s exposure to a given reference entity may be offset partially , or entirely , with a contract to purchase protection from another counterparty on the same or similar reference entity . second , the firm uses credit derivatives to mitigate credit risk associated with its overall derivative receivables and traditional commercial credit lending exposures ( loans and unfunded commitments ) as well as to manage its exposure to residential and commercial mortgages . see note 3 on pages 156--- 173 of this annual report for further information on the firm 2019s mortgage-related exposures . in accomplishing the above , the firm uses different types of credit derivatives . following is a summary of various types of credit derivatives . credit default swaps credit derivatives may reference the credit of either a single refer- ence entity ( 201csingle-name 201d ) or a broad-based index , as described further below . the firm purchases and sells protection on both single- name and index-reference obligations . single-name cds and index cds contracts are both otc derivative contracts . single- name cds are used to manage the default risk of a single reference entity , while cds index are used to manage credit risk associated with the broader credit markets or credit market segments . like the s&p 500 and other market indices , a cds index is comprised of a portfolio of cds across many reference entities . new series of cds indices are established approximately every six months with a new underlying portfolio of reference entities to reflect changes in the credit markets . if one of the reference entities in the index experi- ences a credit event , then the reference entity that defaulted is removed from the index . cds can also be referenced against spe- cific portfolios of reference names or against customized exposure levels based on specific client demands : for example , to provide protection against the first $ 1 million of realized credit losses in a $ 10 million portfolio of exposure . such structures are commonly known as tranche cds . for both single-name cds contracts and index cds , upon the occurrence of a credit event , under the terms of a cds contract neither party to the cds contract has recourse to the reference entity . the protection purchaser has recourse to the protection seller for the difference between the face value of the cds contract and the fair value of the reference obligation at the time of settling the credit derivative contract , also known as the recovery value . the protection purchaser does not need to hold the debt instrument of the underlying reference entity in order to receive amounts due under the cds contract when a credit event occurs . credit-linked notes a credit linked note ( 201ccln 201d ) is a funded credit derivative where the issuer of the cln purchases credit protection on a referenced entity from the note investor . under the contract , the investor pays the issuer par value of the note at the inception of the transaction , and in return , the issuer pays periodic payments to the investor , based on the credit risk of the referenced entity . the issuer also repays the investor the par value of the note at maturity unless the reference entity experiences a specified credit event . in that event , the issuer is not obligated to repay the par value of the note , but rather , the issuer pays the investor the difference between the par value of the note . the gross derivative fair value of derivative receivables is $ 1565518 ; the gross derivative fair value of derivative payables is $ 1519183 ;the nettingadjustment 2013 offsetting receivables/payables of derivative receivables is -1419840 ( 1419840 ) ; the nettingadjustment 2013 offsetting receivables/payables of derivative payables is -1419840 ( 1419840 ) ;the nettingadjustment 2013 cash

( 201casu 2014-09 201d ) . asu 2014-09 outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance , including industry-specific guidance . the guidance also changes the accounting for certain contract costs and revises the criteria for determining if an entity is acting as a principal or agent in certain arrangements . the key changes in the standard that impact the company 2019s revenue recognition relate to the presentation of certain revenue contracts and associated contract costs . the most significant of these changes relates to the presentation of certain distribution costs , which are currently presented net against revenues ( contra-revenue ) and will be presented as an expense on a gross basis . the company adopted asu 2014-09 effective january 1 , 2018 on a full retrospective basis , which will require 2016 and 2017 to be restated in future filings . the cumulative effect adjustment to the 2016 opening retained earnings was not material . the company currently expects the net gross up to revenue to be approximately $ 1 billion with a corresponding gross up to expense for both 2016 and 2017 . consequently , the company expects its gaap operating margin to decline upon adoption due to the gross up of revenue . however , no material impact is expected on the company 2019s as adjusted operating margin . for accounting pronouncements that the company adopted during the year ended december 31 , 2017 and for additional recent

exchange rates or all three could cause the value of aum to decline , which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees . corporate investments portfolio risks . as a leading

( a ) includes collateral related to derivative instruments where an appropriate legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained . derivative receivables reported on the consolidated balance sheets were $ 56.5 billion and $ 64.1 billion at december 31 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively . derivative receivables decreased predominantly as a result of client- driven market-making activities in cib markets , which reduced foreign exchange and interest rate derivative receivables , and increased equity derivative receivables , driven by market movements . derivative receivables amounts represent the fair value of the derivative contracts after giving effect to legally enforceable master netting agreements and cash collateral held by the firm . however , in management 2019s view , the appropriate measure of current credit risk should also take into consideration additional liquid securities ( primarily u.s . government and agency securities and other group of seven nations ( 201cg7 201d ) government bonds ) and other cash collateral held by the firm aggregating $ 16.1 billion and $ 22.7 billion at december 31 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively , that may be used as security when the fair value of the client 2019s exposure is in the firm 2019s favor . in addition to the collateral described in the preceding paragraph , the firm also holds additional collateral ( primarily cash , g7 government securities , other liquid government-agency and guaranteed securities , and corporate debt and equity securities ) delivered by clients at the initiation of transactions , as well as collateral related to contracts that have a non-daily call frequency and collateral that the firm has agreed to return but has not yet settled as of the reporting date . although this collateral does not reduce the balances and is not included in the table above , it is available as security against potential exposure that could arise should the fair value of the client 2019s derivative transactions move in the firm 2019s favor . the derivative receivables fair value , net of all collateral , also does not include other credit enhancements , such as letters of credit . for additional information on the firm 2019s use of collateral agreements , see note 5 . while useful as a current view of credit exposure , the net fair value of the derivative receivables does not capture the potential future variability of that credit exposure . to capture the potential future variability of credit exposure , the firm calculates , on a client-by-client basis , three measures of potential derivatives-related credit loss : peak , derivative risk equivalent ( 201cdre 201d ) , and average exposure ( 201cavg 201d ) . these measures all incorporate netting and collateral benefits , where applicable . peak represents a conservative measure of potential exposure to a counterparty calculated in a manner that is broadly equivalent to a 97.5% ( 97.5 % ) confidence level over the life of the transaction . peak is the primary measure used by the firm for setting of credit limits for derivative transactions , senior management reporting and derivatives exposure management . dre exposure is a measure that expresses the risk of derivative exposure on a basis intended to be equivalent to the risk of loan exposures . dre is a less extreme measure of potential credit loss than peak and is used for aggregating derivative credit risk exposures with loans and other credit risk . finally , avg is a measure of the expected fair value of the firm 2019s derivative receivables at future time periods , including the benefit of collateral . avg exposure over the total life of the derivative contract is used as the primary metric for pricing purposes and is used to calculate credit risk capital and the cva , as further described below . the three year avg exposure was $ 29.0 billion and $ 31.1 billion at december 31 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively , compared with derivative receivables , net of all collateral , of $ 40.4 billion and $ 41.4 billion at december 31 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively . the fair value of the firm 2019s derivative receivables incorporates cva to reflect the credit quality of counterparties . cva is based on the firm 2019s avg to a counterparty and the counterparty 2019s credit spread in the credit derivatives market . the firm believes that active risk management is essential to controlling the dynamic credit risk in the derivatives portfolio . in addition , the firm 2019s risk management process takes into consideration the potential . the interest rate of 2017 is $ 24673 ;

( a ) the table shows the impact of consolidating the assets and liabilities of the multi- seller conduits at their current carrying value ; as such , there would be no income statement or capital impact at the date of consolidation . if the firm were required to consolidate the assets and liabilities of the conduits at fair value , the tier 1 capital ratio would be approximately 10.8% ( 10.8 % ) . the fair value of the assets is primarily based upon pricing for comparable transactions . the fair value of these assets could change significantly because the pricing of conduit transactions is renegotiated with the client , generally , on an annual basis and due to changes in current market conditions . ( b ) consolidation is assumed to occur on the first day of the quarter , at the quarter-end levels , in order to provide a meaningful adjustment to average assets in the denomi- nator of the leverage ratio . the firm could fund purchases of assets from vies should it become necessary . 2007 activity in july 2007 , a reverse repurchase agreement collateralized by prime residential mortgages held by a firm-administered multi-seller conduit was put to jpmorgan chase under its deal-specific liquidity facility . the asset was transferred to and recorded by jpmorgan chase at its par value based on the fair value of the collateral that supported the reverse repurchase agreement . during the fourth quarter of 2007 , additional information regarding the value of the collateral , including performance statistics , resulted in the determi- nation by the firm that the fair value of the collateral was impaired . impairment losses were allocated to the eln holder ( the party that absorbs the majority of the expected loss from the conduit ) in accor- dance with the contractual provisions of the eln note . on october 29 , 2007 , certain structured cdo assets originated in the second quarter of 2007 and backed by subprime mortgages were transferred to the firm from two firm-administered multi-seller conduits . it became clear in october that commercial paper investors and rating agencies were becoming increasingly concerned about cdo assets backed by subprime mortgage exposures . because of these concerns , and to ensure the continuing viability of the two conduits as financing vehicles for clients and as investment alternatives for commercial paper investors , the firm , in its role as administrator , transferred the cdo assets out of the multi-seller con- duits . the structured cdo assets were transferred to the firm at . the assets of reported is $ 2175.1 ; the assets of pro forma ( a ) ( b ) is $ 2218.2 ;the liabilities of reported is 2008.2 ; the liabilities of pro forma ( a ) ( b ) is 2051.3 ;the tier 1 capital ratio of reported is 10.9% ( 10.9 % ) ; the tier 1 capital ratio of pro forma ( a ) ( b ) is 10.9% ( 10.9 % ) ;the tier 1 leverage ratio of reported is 6.9 ; the tier 1 leverage ratio of pro forma ( a ) ( b ) is 6.8 ;",

were reported , an increase of 101 mmboe from december 31 , 2013 . the following table shows changes in total proved undeveloped reserves for 2014 : ( mmboe ) . significant additions to proved undeveloped reserves during 2014 included 121 mmboe in the eagle ford and 61 mmboe in the bakken shale plays due to development drilling . transfers from proved undeveloped to proved developed reserves included 67 mmboe in the eagle ford , 26 mmboe in the bakken and 1 mmboe in the oklahoma resource basins due to development drilling and completions . costs incurred in 2014 , 2013 and 2012 relating to the development of proved undeveloped reserves , were $ 3149 million , $ 2536 million and $ 1995 million . a total of 102 mmboe was booked as extensions , discoveries or other additions due to the application of reliable technology . technologies included statistical analysis of production performance , decline curve analysis , pressure and rate transient analysis , reservoir simulation and volumetric analysis . the statistical nature of production performance coupled with highly certain reservoir continuity or quality within the reliable technology areas and sufficient proved undeveloped locations establish the reasonable certainty criteria required for booking proved reserves . projects can remain in proved undeveloped reserves for extended periods in certain situations such as large development projects which take more than five years to complete , or the timing of when additional gas compression is needed . of the 728 mmboe of proved undeveloped reserves at december 31 , 2014 , 19 percent of the volume is associated with projects that have been included in proved reserves for more than five years . the majority of this volume is related to a compression project in e.g . that was sanctioned by our board of directors in 2004 . the timing of the installation of compression is being driven by the reservoir performance with this project intended to maintain maximum production levels . performance of this field since the board sanctioned the project has far exceeded expectations . estimates of initial dry gas in place increased by roughly 10 percent between 2004 and 2010 . during 2012 , the compression project received the approval of the e.g . government , allowing design and planning work to progress towards implementation , with completion expected by mid-2016 . the other component of alba proved undeveloped reserves is an infill well approved in 2013 and to be drilled in the second quarter of 2015 . proved undeveloped reserves for the north gialo development , located in the libyan sahara desert , were booked for the first time in 2010 . this development , which is anticipated to take more than five years to develop , is executed by the operator and encompasses a multi-year drilling program including the design , fabrication and installation of extensive liquid handling and gas recycling facilities . anecdotal evidence from similar development projects in the region lead to an expected project execution time frame of more than five years from the time the reserves were initially booked . interruptions associated with the civil unrest in 2011 and third-party labor strikes and civil unrest in 2013-2014 have also extended the project duration . as of december 31 , 2014 , future

) in 2008 and $ 415 million in 2007 . sales volumes decreased sig- nificantly in 2009 compared with 2008 reflecting weak customer demand and reduced production capacity resulting from the shutdown of a paper machine at the franklin mill in december 2008 and the conversion of the bastrop mill to pulp production in june 2008 . average sales price realizations were lower reflecting slight declines for uncoated freesheet paper in domestic markets and significant declines in export markets . margins were also unfavorably affected by a higher proportion of shipments to lower-margin export markets . input costs , however , were favorable due to lower wood and chemical costs and sig- nificantly lower energy costs . freight costs were also lower . planned maintenance downtime costs in 2009 were comparable with 2008 . operating costs were favorable , reflecting cost control efforts and strong machine performance . lack-of-order downtime increased to 525000 tons in 2009 , including 120000 tons related to the shutdown of a paper machine at our franklin mill in the 2008 fourth quarter , from 135000 tons in 2008 . operating earnings in 2009 included $ 671 million of alternative fuel mixture cred- its , $ 223 million of costs associated with the shutdown of our franklin mill and $ 9 million of other shutdown costs , while operating earnings in 2008 included $ 30 million of costs for the shutdown of a paper machine at our franklin mill . looking ahead to 2010 , first-quarter sales volumes are expected to increase slightly from fourth-quarter 2009 levels . average sales price realizations should be higher , reflecting the full-quarter impact of sales price increases announced in the fourth quarter for converting and envelope grades of uncoated free- sheet paper and an increase in prices to export markets . however , input costs for wood , energy and chemicals are expected to continue to increase . planned maintenance downtime costs should be lower and operating costs should be favorable . brazil ian papers net sales for 2009 of $ 960 mil- lion increased from $ 950 million in 2008 and $ 850 million in 2007 . operating profits for 2009 were $ 112 million compared with $ 186 million in 2008 and $ 174 million in 2007 . sales volumes increased in 2009 compared with 2008 for both paper and pulp reflect- ing higher export shipments . average sales price realizations were lower due to strong competitive pressures in the brazilian domestic market in the second half of the year , lower export prices and unfavorable foreign exchange rates . margins were unfavorably affected by a higher proportion of lower margin export sales . input costs for wood and chem- icals were favorable , but these benefits were partially offset by higher energy costs . planned maintenance downtime costs were lower , and operating costs were also favorable . earnings in 2009 were adversely impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange effects . entering 2010 , sales volumes are expected to be seasonally lower compared with the fourth quarter of 2009 . profit margins are expected to be slightly higher reflecting a more favorable geographic sales mix and improving sales price realizations in export markets , partially offset by higher planned main- tenance outage costs . european papers net sales in 2009 were $ 1.3 bil- lion compared with $ 1.7 billion in 2008

2009 were lower than in 2008 primarily due to reduced sales of uncoated freesheet paper following the closure of the inverurie mill in 2009 . average sales price realizations decreased significantly in 2009 across most of western europe , but margins increased in poland and russia reflecting the effect of local currency devaluations . input costs were favorable as lower wood costs , particularly in russia , were only partially offset by higher energy costs in poland and higher chemical costs . planned main- tenance downtime costs were higher in 2009 than in 2008 , while manufacturing operating costs were lower . operating profits in 2009 also reflect favorable foreign exchange impacts . looking ahead to 2010 , sales volumes are expected to decline from strong 2009 fourth-quarter

use this non-gaap financial measure of cash flow to focus management and investors on the amount of cash available for debt repayment , dividend distributions , acquisition opportunities , and share repurchases . our cash flow metric is reconciled to the most comparable gaap measure , as follows: . year-over-year change 22.4 % (  % ) 87.5 % (  % ) year-over-year changes in cash flow ( as defined ) were driven by improved performance in working capital resulting from the benefit derived from the pringles acquisition , as well as changes in the level of capital expenditures during the three-year period . investing activities our net cash used in investing activities for 2012 amounted to $ 3245 million , an increase of $ 2658 million compared with 2011 primarily attributable to the $ 2668 acquisition of pringles in capital spending in 2012 included investments in our supply chain infrastructure , and to support capacity requirements in certain markets , including pringles . in addition , we continued the investment in our information technology infrastructure related to the reimplementation and upgrade of our sap platform . net cash used in investing activities of $ 587 million in 2011 increased by $ 122 million compared with 2010 , reflecting capital projects for our reimplementation and upgrade of our sap platform and investments in our supply chain . cash paid for additions to properties as a percentage of net sales has decreased to 3.8% ( 3.8 % ) in 2012 , from 4.5% ( 4.5 % ) in 2011 , which was an increase from 3.8% ( 3.8 % ) in financing activities in february 2013 , we issued $ 250 million of two-year floating-rate u.s . dollar notes , and $ 400 million of ten-year 2.75% ( 2.75 % ) u.s . dollar notes . the proceeds from these notes will be used for general corporate purposes , including , together with cash on hand , repayment of the $ 750 million aggregate principal amount of our 4.25% ( 4.25 % ) u.s . dollar notes due march 2013 . the floating-rate notes bear interest equal to three-month libor plus 23 basis points , subject to quarterly reset . the notes contain customary covenants that limit the ability of kellogg company and its restricted subsidiaries ( as defined ) to incur certain liens or enter into certain sale and lease-back transactions , as well as a change of control provision . our net cash provided by financing activities was $ 1317 for 2012 , compared to net cash used in financing activities of $ 957 and $ 439 for 2011 and 2010 , respectively . the increase in cash provided from financing activities in 2012 compared to 2011 and 2010 , was primarily due to the issuance of debt related to the acquisition of pringles . total debt was $ 7.9 billion at year-end 2012 and $ 6.0 billion at year-end 2011 . in march 2012 , we entered into interest rate swaps on our $ 500 million five-year 1.875% ( 1.875 % ) fixed rate u.s . dollar notes due 2016 , $ 500 million ten-year 4.15% ( 4.15 % ) fixed rate u.s . dollar notes due 2019 and $ 500 million of our $ 750 million seven-year 4.45% ( 4.45 % ) fixed rate u.s . dollar notes due 2016 . the interest rate swaps effectively converted these notes from their fixed rates to floating rate obligations through maturity . in may 2012 , we issued $ 350 million of three-year 1.125% ( 1.125 % ) u.s . dollar notes , $ 400 million of five-year 1.75% ( 1.75 % ) u.s . dollar notes and $ 700 million of ten-year 3.125% ( 3.125 % ) u.s . dollar notes , resulting in aggregate net proceeds after debt discount of $ 1.442 billion . the proceeds of these notes were used for general corporate purposes , including financing a portion of the acquisition of pringles . in may 2012 , we issued cdn . $ 300 million of two-year 2.10% ( 2.10 % ) fixed rate canadian dollar notes , using the proceeds from these notes for general corporate purposes , which included repayment of intercompany debt . this repayment resulted in cash available to be used for a portion of the acquisition of pringles . in december 2012 , we repaid $ 750 million five-year 5.125% ( 5.125 % ) u.s . dollar notes at maturity with commercial paper . in february 2011 , we entered into interest rate swaps on $ 200 million of our $ 750 million seven-year 4.45% ( 4.45 % ) fixed rate u.s . dollar notes due 2016 . the interest rate swaps effectively converted this portion of the notes from a fixed rate to a floating rate obligation through maturity . in april 2011 , we repaid $ 945 million ten-year 6.60% ( 6.60 % ) u.s . dollar notes at maturity with commercial paper . in may 2011 , we issued $ 400 million of seven-year 3.25% ( 3.25 % ) fixed rate u.s . dollar notes , using the proceeds of $ 397 million for general corporate purposes and repayment of commercial paper . during 2011 , we entered into interest rate swaps with notional amounts totaling $ 400 million , which effectively converted these notes from a fixed rate to a floating rate obligation through maturity . in november 2011 , we issued $ 500 million of five-year 1.875% ( 1.875 % ) fixed rate u . s . dollar notes , using the proceeds of $ 498 million for general corporate purposes and repayment of commercial paper . during 2012 , we entered into interest rate swaps which effectively converted these notes from a fixed rate to a floating rate obligation through maturity . in april 2010 , our board of directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase shares of our common stock amounting to $ 2.5 billion during 2010 through 2012 . this three year authorization replaced previous share buyback programs which had authorized stock repurchases of up to $ 1.1 billion for 2010 and $ 650 million for 2009 . under this program , we repurchased approximately 1 million , 15 million and 21 million shares of common stock for $ 63 million , $ 793 million and $ 1.1 billion during 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively . in december 2012 , our board of directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase shares of our common stock amounting to $ 300 million during 2013 . we paid quarterly dividends to shareholders totaling $ 1.74 per share in 2012 , $ 1.67 per share in 2011 and $ 1.56 per share in 2010 . total cash paid for dividends increased by 3.0% ( 3.0 % ) in 2012 and 3.4% ( 3.4 % ) in 2011 . in march 2011 , we entered into an unsecured four- year credit agreement which allows us to borrow , on a revolving credit basis , up to $ 2.0 billion . our long-term debt agreements contain customary covenants that limit kellogg company and some of its subsidiaries from incurring certain liens or from entering into certain sale and lease-back transactions . some agreements also contain change in control provisions . however , they do not contain acceleration of maturity clauses that are dependent on credit ratings . a change in our credit ratings could limit our access to the u.s . short-term debt market and/or increase the cost of refinancing long-term debt in the future . however , even under these circumstances , we would continue to have access to our four-year credit agreement , which expires in march 2015 . this source of liquidity is unused and available on an unsecured basis , although we do not currently plan to use it . capital and credit markets , including commercial paper markets , continued to experience instability and disruption as the u.s . and global economies underwent a period of extreme uncertainty . throughout this period of uncertainty , we continued to have access to the u.s. , european , and canadian commercial paper markets . our commercial paper and term debt credit ratings were not affected by the changes in the credit environment . we monitor the financial strength of our third-party financial institutions , including those that hold our cash and cash equivalents as well as those who serve as counterparties to our credit facilities , our derivative financial instruments , and other arrangements . we are in compliance with all covenants as of december 29 , 2012 . we continue to believe that we will be able to meet our interest and principal repayment obligations and maintain our debt covenants for the foreseeable future , while still meeting our operational needs , including the pursuit of selected bolt-on acquisitions . this will be accomplished through our strong cash flow , our short- term borrowings , and our maintenance of credit facilities on a global basis. . the net cash provided by operating activities of 2012 is $ 1758 ; the net cash

securitizations the company securitizes a number of different asset classes as a means of strengthening its balance sheet and accessing competitive financing rates in the market . under these

the structure of the trust meets certain accounting guidelines , trust assets are treated as sold and are no longer reflected as assets of the company . if these guidelines are not met , the assets continue to be recorded as the company 2019s assets , with the financing activity recorded as liabilities on citigroup 2019s balance sheet . citigroup also assists its clients in securitizing their financial assets and packages and securitizes financial assets purchased in the financial markets . the company may also provide administrative , asset management , underwriting , liquidity facilities and/or other services to the resulting securitization entities and may continue to service some of these financial assets . elimination of qspes and changes in the fin 46 ( r ) consolidation model the fasb has issued an exposure draft of a proposed standard that would eliminate qualifying special purpose entities ( qspes ) from the guidance in fasb statement no . 140 , accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities ( sfas 140 ) . while the proposed standard has not been finalized , if it is issued in its current form it will have a significant impact on citigroup 2019s consolidated financial statements as the company will lose sales treatment for certain assets previously sold to a qspe , as well as for certain future sales , and for certain transfers of portions of assets that do not meet the proposed definition of 201cparticipating interests . 201d this proposed revision could become effective on january 1 , 2010 . in connection with the proposed changes to sfas 140 , the fasb has also issued a separate exposure draft of a proposed standard that proposes three key changes to the consolidation model in fasb interpretation no . 46 ( revised december 2003 ) , 201cconsolidation of variable interest entities 201d ( fin 46 ( r ) ) . first , the revised standard would include former qspes in the scope of fin 46 ( r ) . in addition , fin 46 ( r ) would be amended to change the method of analyzing which party to a variable interest entity ( vie ) should consolidate the vie ( such consolidating entity is referred to as the 201cprimary beneficiary 201d ) to a qualitative determination of power combined with benefits or losses instead of the current risks and rewards model . finally , the proposed standard would require that the analysis of primary beneficiaries be re-evaluated whenever circumstances change . the existing standard requires reconsideration only when specified reconsideration events occur . the fasb is currently deliberating these proposed standards , and they are , accordingly , still subject to change . since qspes will likely be eliminated from sfas 140 and thus become subject to fin 46 ( r ) consolidation guidance and because the fin 46 ( r ) method of determining which party must consolidate a vie will likely change should this proposed standard become effective , the company expects to consolidate certain of the currently unconsolidated vies and qspes with which citigroup was involved as of december 31 , 2008 . the company 2019s estimate of the incremental impact of adopting these changes on citigroup 2019s consolidated balance sheets and risk-weighted assets , based on december 31 , 2008 balances , our understanding of the proposed changes to the standards and a proposed january 1 , 2010 effective date , is presented below . the actual impact of adopting the amended standards as of january 1 , 2010 could materially differ . the pro forma impact of the proposed changes on gaap assets and risk- weighted assets , assuming application of existing risk-based capital rules , at january 1 , 2010 ( based on the balances at december 31 , 2008 ) would result in the consolidation of incremental assets as follows: . the table reflects ( i ) the estimated portion of the assets of qspes to which citigroup , acting as principal , has transferred assets and received sales treatment as of december 31 , 2008 ( totaling approximately $ 822.1 billion ) , and ( ii ) the estimated assets of significant unconsolidated vies as of december 31 , 2008 with which citigroup is involved ( totaling approximately $ 288.0 billion ) that would be consolidated under the proposal . due to the variety of transaction structures and level of the company 2019s involvement in individual qspes and vies , only a subset of the qspes and vies with which the company is involved are expected to be consolidated under the proposed change . a complete description of the company 2019s accounting for securitized assets can be found in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements on page 122. . the credit cards of incremental gaap assets is $ 91.9 ; the credit cards of

( a ) includes collateral related to derivative instruments where an appropriate legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained . derivative receivables reported on the consolidated balance sheets were $ 64.1 billion and $ 59.7 billion at december 31 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively . these amounts represent the fair value of the derivative contracts after giving effect to legally enforceable master netting agreements and cash collateral held by the firm . however , in management 2019s view , the appropriate measure of current credit risk should also take into consideration additional liquid securities ( primarily u.s . government and agency securities and other group of seven nations ( 201cg7 201d ) government bonds ) and other cash collateral held by the firm aggregating $ 22.7 billion and $ 16.6 billion at december 31 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively , that may be used as security when the fair value of the client 2019s exposure is in the firm 2019s favor . the change in derivative receivables was predominantly related to client-driven market-making activities in cib . the increase in derivative receivables reflected the impact of market movements , which increased foreign exchange receivables , partially offset by reduced commodity derivative receivables . in addition to the collateral described in the preceding paragraph , the firm also holds additional collateral ( primarily cash , g7 government securities , other liquid government-agency and guaranteed securities , and corporate debt and equity securities ) delivered by clients at the initiation of transactions , as well as collateral related to contracts that have a non-daily call frequency and collateral that the firm has agreed to return but has not yet settled as of the reporting date . although this collateral does not reduce the balances and is not included in the table above , it is available as security against potential exposure that could arise should the fair value of the client 2019s derivative transactions move in the firm 2019s favor . the derivative receivables fair value , net of all collateral , also does not include other credit enhancements , such as letters of credit . for additional information on the firm 2019s use of collateral agreements , see note 6 . while useful as a current view of credit exposure , the net fair value of the derivative receivables does not capture the potential future variability of that credit exposure . to capture the potential future variability of credit exposure , the firm calculates , on a client-by-client basis , three measures of potential derivatives-related credit loss : peak , derivative risk equivalent ( 201cdre 201d ) , and average exposure ( 201cavg 201d ) . these measures all incorporate netting and collateral benefits , where applicable . peak represents a conservative measure of potential exposure to a counterparty calculated in a manner that is broadly equivalent to a 97.5% ( 97.5 % ) confidence level over the life of the transaction . peak is the primary measure used by the firm for setting of credit limits for derivative transactions , senior management reporting and derivatives exposure management . dre exposure is a measure that expresses the risk of derivative exposure on a basis intended to be equivalent to the risk of loan exposures . dre is a less extreme measure of potential credit loss than peak and is used for aggregating derivative credit risk exposures with loans and other credit risk . finally , avg is a measure of the expected fair value of the firm 2019s derivative receivables at future time periods , including the benefit of collateral . avg exposure over the total life of the derivative contract is used as the primary metric for pricing purposes and is used to calculate credit capital and the cva , as further described below . the three year avg exposure was $ 31.1 billion and $ 32.4 billion at december 31 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively , compared with derivative receivables , net of all collateral , of $ 41.4 billion and $ 43.1 billion at december 31 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively . the fair value of the firm 2019s derivative receivables incorporates an adjustment , the cva , to reflect the credit quality of counterparties . the cva is based on the firm 2019s avg to a counterparty and the counterparty 2019s credit spread in the credit derivatives market . the primary components of changes in cva are credit spreads , new deal activity or unwinds , and changes in the underlying market environment . the firm believes that active risk management is essential to controlling the dynamic credit . the interest rate of 2016 is $ 28302 ;

portion of the notes issued by the spe . in certain transactions , the investor 2019s maximum risk of loss is limited and the company absorbs risk of loss above a specified level . the company 2019s maximum risk of loss in these transactions is defined as the amount invested in notes issued by the spe and the notional amount of any risk of loss absorbed by the company through a separate instrument issued by the spe . the derivative instrument held by the company may generate a receivable from the spe ( for example , where the company purchases credit protection from the spe in

are exposed to both credit and interest rate risk . all of our investments are investment grade to minimize our credit risk . while individual securities have varying durations , as of may 31 , 2015 the weighted average remaining duration of our short-term investments and cash equivalents portfolio was 79 days . to date we have not experienced difficulty accessing the credit markets or incurred higher interest costs . future volatility in the capital markets , however , may increase costs associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments or affect our ability to access those markets . we believe that existing cash , cash equivalents , short-term investments and cash generated by operations , together with access to external sources of funds as described above , will be sufficient to meet our domestic and foreign capital needs in the foreseeable future . we utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies to manage our worldwide cash and deploy funds to locations where they are needed . we routinely repatriate a portion of our foreign earnings for which u.s . taxes have previously been provided . we also indefinitely reinvest a significant portion of our foreign earnings , and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these earnings . should we require additional capital in the united states , we may elect to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign funds or raise capital in the united states through debt . if we were to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign funds , we would be required to accrue and pay additional u.s . taxes less applicable foreign tax credits . if we elect to raise capital in the united states through debt , we would incur additional interest expense . off-balance sheet arrangements in connection with various contracts and agreements , we routinely provide indemnification relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights , coverage for legal issues that arise and other items where we are acting as the guarantor . currently , we have several such agreements in place . however , based on our historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss , we have determined that the fair value of such indemnification is not material to our financial position or results of operations . contractual obligations our significant long-term contractual obligations as of may 31 , 2015 and significant endorsement contracts , including related marketing commitments , entered into through the date of this report are as follows: . ( 1 ) the cash payments due for long-term debt include estimated interest payments . estimates of interest payments are based on outstanding principal amounts , applicable fixed interest rates or currently effective interest rates as of may 31 , 2015 ( if variable ) , timing of scheduled payments and the term of the debt obligations . ( 2 ) the amounts listed for endorsement contracts represent approximate amounts of base compensation and minimum guaranteed royalty fees we are obligated to pay athlete , sport team and league endorsers of our products . actual payments under some contracts may be higher than the amounts listed as these contracts provide for bonuses to be paid to the endorsers based upon athletic achievements and/or royalties on product sales in future periods . actual payments under some contracts may also be lower as these contracts include provisions for reduced payments if athletic performance declines in future periods . in addition to the cash payments , we are obligated to furnish our endorsers with nike product for their use . it is not possible to determine how much we will spend on this product on an annual basis as the contracts generally do not stipulate a specific amount of cash to be spent on the product . the amount of product provided to the endorsers will depend on many factors , including general playing conditions , the number of sporting events in which they participate and our own decisions regarding product and marketing initiatives . in addition , the costs to design , develop , source and purchase the products furnished to the endorsers are incurred over a period of time and are not necessarily tracked separately from similar costs incurred for products sold to customers. . the operating leases of description of commitment 2016 is $ 447 ; the operating leases of description of commitment 2017 is $ 423 ; the operating leases of description of commitment 2018 is $ 371 ; the operating leases of description of commitment 2019 is $ 311 ; the operating leases of description of commitment 2020 is $ 268 ; the operating leases of description of commitment thereafter is $ 1154 ; the operating leases of total is $ 2974 ;the capital leases of description of commitment 2016 is 2 ; the capital leases of description of commitment 2017 is 2 ; the capital leases of description of commitment 2018 is 1 ; the capital leases of description of commitment 2019 is 2014 ; the capital leases of description of commitment 2020 is 2014 ; the capital leases of description of commitment thereafter is 2014 ; the capital leases of total is 5 ;the long-term debt ( 1 ) of description of commitment 2016 is 142 ; the long-term debt ( 1 ) of description of commitment 2017 is 77 ; the long-term debt ( 1 ) of description of commitment 2018 is 55 ; the long-term debt ( 1 ) of description of commitment 2019 is 36 ; the long-term debt ( 1 ) of description of commitment 2020 is 36 ; the long-term debt ( 1 ) of description of commitment thereafter is 1451 ; the long-term debt ( 1 ) of total is 1797 ;the endorsement contracts ( 2 ) of description of commitment 2016 is 1009 ; the endorsement contracts ( 2 ) of description of commitment 2017 is 919 ; the endorsement contracts ( 2 ) of description of commitment 2018 is 882 ; the endorsement contracts ( 2 ) of description of commitment 2019 is 706 ; the endorsement contracts ( 2 ) of description of commitment 2020 is 533 ; the endorsement contracts ( 2 ) of description of commitment thereafter is 2143 ; the endorsement contracts ( 2 ) of total is 6192 ;the product purchase obligations ( 3 ) of description of commitment 2016 is 3735 ; the product purchase obligations ( 3 ) of description of commitment 2017 is 2014 ; the product purchase obligations ( 3 ) of description of commitment 2018 is 2014 ; the product purchase obligations ( 3 ) of description of commitment 2019 is 2014 ; the product purchase obligations ( 3 ) of description of commitment 2020 is 2014 ; the product purchase obligations ( 3 ) of description of commitment thereafter is 2014 ; the product purchase obligations ( 3 ) of total is 3735 ;the other ( 4 ) of description of commitment 2016 is 343 ; the other ( 4 ) of description of commitment 2017 is 152 ; the other ( 4 ) of description of commitment 2018 is 75 ; the other ( 4 ) of description of commitment 2019 is 72 ; the other ( 4 ) of description of commitment 2020 is 36 ; the other ( 4 ) of description of commitment thereafter is 92 ; the other ( 4 ) of total is 770 ;the total of description of commitment 2016 is $ 5678 ; the total of description of commitment 2017 is $ 1573 ; the total of description of commitment 2018 is $ 1384 ; the total of description of commitment 2019 is $ 1125 ; the total of description of commitment 2020 is $ 873 ; the total of description of commitment thereafter is $ 4840 ; the total of total is $ 15473 ;",

volatility and improved client activity , compared with a low volatility environment in 2017 . in investment banking , industry-wide mergers and acquisitions volumes increased compared with 2017 , while industry-wide underwriting transactions decreased . our other principal transactions revenues benefited from company-specific events , including sales , and strong corporate performance , while investments in public equities reflected losses , as global equity prices generally decreased in 2018 , particularly towards the end of the year . in investment management , our assets under supervision increased reflecting net inflows in liquidity products , fixed income assets and equity assets , partially offset by depreciation in client assets , primarily in equity assets . if market-making or investment banking activity levels decline , or assets under supervision decline , or asset prices continue to decline , net revenues would likely be negatively impacted . see 201csegment operating results 201d for further information about the operating environment and material trends and uncertainties that may impact our results of operations . during 2017 , generally higher asset prices and tighter credit spreads were supportive of industry-wide underwriting activities , investment management performance and other principal transactions . however , low levels of volatility in equity , fixed income , currency and commodity markets continued to negatively affect our market-making activities . 2018 versus 2017 net revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $ 36.62 billion for 2018 , 12% ( 12 % ) higher than 2017 , primarily due to significantly higher market making revenues and net interest income , as well as higher investment management revenues and investment banking revenues . non-interest revenues . investment banking revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $ 7.86 billion for 2018 , 7% ( 7 % ) higher than 2017 . revenues in financial advisory were higher , reflecting an increase in industry-wide completed mergers and acquisitions volumes . revenues in underwriting were slightly higher , due to significantly higher revenues in equity underwriting , driven by initial public offerings , partially offset by lower revenues in debt underwriting , reflecting a decline in leveraged finance activity . investment management revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $ 6.51 billion for 2018 , 12% ( 12 % ) higher than 2017 , primarily due to significantly higher incentive fees , as a result of

    "prompt": "what was the change in millions in net interest income between 2011 and 2012?\nconsolidated income statement review our consolidated income statement is presented in item 8 of this report . net income for 2012 was $ 3.0 billion compared with $ 3.1 billion for 2011 . revenue growth of 8 percent and a decline in the provision for credit losses were more than offset by a 16 percent increase in noninterest expense in 2012 compared to 2011 . further detail is included in the net interest income , noninterest income , provision for credit losses and noninterest expense portions of this consolidated income statement review . net interest income table 2 : net interest income and net interest margin year ended december 31 dollars in millions 2012 2011 . changes in net interest income and margin result from the interaction of the volume and composition of interest-earning assets and related yields , interest-bearing liabilities and related rates paid , and noninterest-bearing sources of funding . see the statistical information ( unaudited ) 2013 average consolidated balance sheet and net interest analysis and analysis of year-to-year changes in net interest income in item 8 of this report and the discussion of purchase accounting accretion of purchased impaired loans in the consolidated balance sheet review in this item 7 for additional information . the increase in net interest income in 2012 compared with 2011 was primarily due to the impact of the rbc bank ( usa ) acquisition , organic loan growth and lower funding costs . purchase accounting accretion remained stable at $ 1.1 billion in both periods . the net interest margin was 3.94% ( 3.94 % ) for 2012 and 3.92% ( 3.92 % ) for 2011 . the increase in the comparison was primarily due to a decrease in the weighted-average rate accrued on total interest- bearing liabilities of 29 basis points , largely offset by a 21 basis point decrease on the yield on total interest-earning assets . the decrease in the rate on interest-bearing liabilities was primarily due to the runoff of maturing retail certificates of deposit and the redemption of additional trust preferred and hybrid capital securities during 2012 , in addition to an increase in fhlb borrowings and commercial paper as lower-cost funding sources . the decrease in the yield on interest-earning assets was primarily due to lower rates on new loan volume and lower yields on new securities in the current low rate environment . with respect to the first quarter of 2013 , we expect net interest income to decline by two to three percent compared to fourth quarter 2012 net interest income of $ 2.4 billion , due to a decrease in purchase accounting accretion of up to $ 50 to $ 60 million , including lower expected cash recoveries . for the full year 2013 , we expect net interest income to decrease compared with 2012 , assuming an expected decline in purchase accounting accretion of approximately $ 400 million , while core net interest income is expected to increase in the year-over-year comparison . we believe our net interest margin will come under pressure in 2013 , due to the expected decline in purchase accounting accretion and assuming that the current low rate environment continues . noninterest income noninterest income totaled $ 5.9 billion for 2012 and $ 5.6 billion for 2011 . the overall increase in the comparison was primarily due to an increase in residential mortgage loan sales revenue driven by higher loan origination volume , gains on sales of visa class b common shares and higher corporate service fees , largely offset by higher provision for residential mortgage repurchase obligations . asset management revenue , including blackrock , totaled $ 1.2 billion in 2012 compared with $ 1.1 billion in 2011 . this increase was primarily due to higher earnings from our blackrock investment . discretionary assets under management increased to $ 112 billion at december 31 , 2012 compared with $ 107 billion at december 31 , 2011 driven by stronger average equity markets , positive net flows and strong sales performance . for 2012 , consumer services fees were $ 1.1 billion compared with $ 1.2 billion in 2011 . the decline reflected the regulatory impact of lower interchange fees on debit card transactions partially offset by customer growth . as further discussed in the retail banking portion of the business segments review section of this item 7 , the dodd-frank limits on interchange rates were effective october 1 , 2011 and had a negative impact on revenue of approximately $ 314 million in 2012 and $ 75 million in 2011 . this impact was partially offset by higher volumes of merchant , customer credit card and debit card transactions and the impact of the rbc bank ( usa ) acquisition . corporate services revenue increased by $ .3 billion , or 30 percent , to $ 1.2 billion in 2012 compared with $ .9 billion in 2011 due to higher commercial mortgage servicing revenue and higher merger and acquisition advisory fees in 2012 . the major components of corporate services revenue are treasury management revenue , corporate finance fees , including revenue from capital markets-related products and services , and commercial mortgage servicing revenue , including commercial mortgage banking activities . see the product revenue portion of this consolidated income statement review for further detail . the pnc financial services group , inc . 2013 form 10-k 39 . the net interest income of 2012 is $ 9640 ; the net interest income of 2011 is $ 8700 ;the net interest margin of 2012 is 3.94% ( 3.94 % ) ; the net interest margin of 2011 is 3.92% ( 3.92 % ) ;",

however , when the related taxes are paid they are required to be shown as part of cash provided by operating activities . thus , operating cash flows for 2007 were penalized due to cash income tax payments of approximately $ 630 million in 2007 that related to the sale of the global branded pharmaceuticals business . non-pharmaceutical related cash income tax payments were approximately $ 475 million lower than 2006 due to normal timing differences in tax payments , which benefited cash flows . accounts receivable and inventory increases reduced cash flows in 2007 , but decreased cash flow less than in 2006 , resulting in a year-on-year benefit to cash flows of $ 323 million . the category 201cother-net 201d in the preceding table reflects changes in other asset and liability accounts , including the impact of cash payments made in connection with 3m 2019s restructuring actions ( note 4 ) . in 2006 , cash flows provided by operating activities decreased $ 365 million . this decrease was due in large part to an increase of approximately $ 600 million in tax payments in 2006 compared with 2005 . the higher tax payments in 2006 primarily related to the company 2019s repatriation of $ 1.7 billion of foreign earnings in the united states pursuant to the provisions of the american jobs creation act of 2004 . the category 201cother-net 201d in the preceding table reflects changes in other asset and liability accounts , including outstanding liabilities at december 31 , 2006 , related to 3m 2019s restructuring actions ( note 4 ) . cash flows from investing activities : years ended december 31 . investments in property , plant and equipment enable growth in diverse markets , helping to meet product demand and increasing manufacturing efficiency . in 2007 , numerous plants were opened or expanded internationally . this included two facilities in korea ( respirator manufacturing facility and optical plant ) , an optical plant in poland , industrial adhesives/tapes facilities in both brazil and the philippines , a plant in russia ( corrosion protection , industrial adhesive and tapes , and respirators ) , a plant in china ( optical systems , industrial adhesives and tapes , and personal care ) , an expansion in canada ( construction and home improvement business ) , in addition to investments in india , mexico and other countries . in addition , 3m expanded manufacturing capabilities in the u.s. , including investments in industrial adhesives/tapes and optical . 3m also exited several high-cost underutilized manufacturing facilities and streamlined several supply chains by relocating equipment from one facility to another . the streamlining work has primarily occurred inside the u.s . and is in addition to the streamlining achieved through plant construction . as a result of this increased activity , capital expenditures were $ 1.422 billion in 2007 , an increase of $ 254 million when compared to 2006 . the company expects capital expenditures to total approximately $ 1.3 billion to $ 1.4 billion in 2008 . refer to the preceding 201ccapital spending/net property , plant and equipment 201d section for more detail . refer to note 2 for information on 2007 , 2006 and 2005 acquisitions . note 2 also provides information on the proceeds from the sale of businesses . the company is actively considering additional acquisitions , investments and strategic alliances , and from time to time may also divest certain businesses . purchases of marketable securities and investments and proceeds from sale ( or maturities ) of marketable securities and investments are primarily attributable to asset-backed securities , agency securities , corporate medium-term note securities , auction rate securities and other securities , which are classified as available-for-sale . refer to note 9 for more details about 3m 2019s diversified marketable securities portfolio , which totaled $ 1.059 billion as of december 31 , 2007 . purchases of marketable securities , net of sales and maturities , totaled $ 429 million for 2007 and $ 637 million for 2006 . purchases of investments in 2005 include the purchase of 19% ( 19 % ) of ti&m beteiligungsgesellschaft mbh for . the purchases of property plant and equipment ( pp&e ) of 2007 is $ -1422 ( 1422 ) ;

. we may also enter into foreign currency option contracts to hedge anticipated transactions where there is a high probability that anticipated exposures will materialize . the foreign currency forward contracts entered into to hedge antici- pated transactions have been designated as foreign currency cash-flow hedges and have varying maturities through the end of march 2015 . hedge effectiveness of foreign currency forward contracts is based on a hypo- thetical derivative methodology and excludes the portion of fair value attributable to the spot-forward difference which is recorded in current-period earnings . hedge effectiveness of foreign currency option contracts is based on a dollar offset methodology . the ineffective portion of both foreign currency forward and option con- tracts is recorded in current-period earnings . for hedge contracts that are no longer deemed highly effective , hedge accounting is discontinued and gains and losses accumulated in other comprehensive income ( loss ) are reclassified to earnings when the underlying forecasted transaction occurs . if it is probable that the forecasted transaction will no longer occur , then any gains or losses in accumulated other comprehensive income ( loss ) are reclassified to current-period earnings . as of june 30 , 2013 , these foreign currency cash-flow hedges were highly effective in all material respects . at june 30 , 2013 , we had foreign currency forward contracts in the amount of $ 1579.6 million . the foreign currencies included in foreign currency forward contracts ( notional value stated in u.s . dollars ) are principally the british pound ( $ 426.2 million ) , euro ( $ 268.8 million ) , canadian dollar ( $ 198.6 million ) , swiss franc ( $ 111.5 mil- lion ) , australian dollar ( $ 92.1 million ) , thailand baht ( $ 75.5 million ) and hong kong dollar ( $ 58.1 million ) . credit risk as a matter of policy , we only enter into derivative con- tracts with counterparties that have a long-term credit rat- ing of at least a- or higher by at least two nationally recognized rating agencies . the counterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions . exposure to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by any of the counterparties is limited to the gross fair value of con- tracts in asset positions , which totaled $ 21.7 million at june 30 , 2013 . to manage this risk , we have established counterparty credit guidelines that are continually moni- tored . accordingly , management believes risk of loss under these hedging contracts is remote . certain of our derivative financial instruments contain credit-risk-related contingent features . at june 30 , 2013 , we were in a net asset position for certain derivative contracts that contain such features with two counter- parties . the fair value of those contracts as of june 30 , 2013 was approximately $ 4.6 million . as of june 30 , 2013 , we were in compliance with such credit-risk-related contingent features . market risk we use a value-at-risk model to assess the market risk of our derivative financial instruments . value-at-risk repre- sents the potential losses for an instrument or portfolio from adverse changes in market factors for a specified time period and confidence level . we estimate value-at- risk across all of our derivative financial instruments using a model with historical volatilities and correlations calcu- lated over the past 250-day period . the high , low and average measured value-at-risk during fiscal 2013 related to our foreign exchange contracts is as follows: . foreign exchange contracts $ 24.5 $ 19.1 $ 21.9 the model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95 percent confidence level . we used a statistical simulation model that valued our derivative financial instruments against one thousand randomly gen- erated market price paths . our calculated value-at-risk exposure represents an estimate of reasonably possible net losses that would be recognized on our portfolio of derivative financial instruments assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates and is not necessarily indicative of actual results , which may or may not occur . it does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur , since actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated , based upon actual fluctuations in market rates , operating exposures , and the timing thereof , and changes in our portfolio of derivative financial instruments during the year . we believe , however , that any such loss incurred would be offset by the effects of market rate movements on the respective underlying transactions for which the deriva- tive financial instrument was intended . off-balance sheet arrangements we do not maintain any off-balance sheet arrangements , transactions , obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities , other than operating leases , that would be expected to have a material current or future effect upon our financial condition or results of operations . the est{e lauder companies inc . 135 . the foreign exchange contracts of year ended june 30

2012 . the letters of credit secure the company 2019s performance to third parties under certain self-insurance programs and other commitments made in the ordinary course of business . as of december 31 , 2012 and 2011 , guarantees outstanding were $ 96 million and $ 90 million , respectively . the guarantees relate primarily to debt of certain entities in which ppg has an ownership interest and

$ 13 million as of december 31 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively , and the fair values were $ 11 million and $ 21 million , as of december 31 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively . the fair value of each guarantee was estimated by comparing the net present value of two hypothetical cash flow streams , one based on ppg 2019s incremental borrowing rate and the other based on the borrower 2019s incremental borrowing rate , as of the effective date of the guarantee . both streams were discounted at a risk free rate of return . the company does not believe any loss related to these letters of credit , surety bonds or guarantees is likely . 9 . fair value measurement the accounting guidance on fair value measurements establishes a hierarchy with three levels of inputs used to determine fair value . level 1 inputs are quoted prices ( unadjusted ) in active markets for identical assets and liabilities , are considered to be the most reliable evidence of fair value , and should be used whenever available . level 2 inputs are observable prices that are not quoted on active exchanges . level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs employed for measuring the fair value of assets or liabilities . table of contents notes to the consolidated financial statements . the other weighted average 2.27% ( 2.27 % ) as of dec . 31 2012 and 3.72% ( 3.72 % ) as of december 31 2011 of 2012 is

( ii ) the probability of a default event occurring for each counterparty , as derived from observed or estimated cds spreads ; and ( iii ) estimated recovery rates implied by cds , adjusted to consider the differences in recovery rates as a derivative creditor relative to those reflected in cds spreads , which generally reflect senior unsecured creditor risk . as such , the firm estimates derivatives cva relative to the relevant benchmark interest rate . 2022 dva is taken to reflect the credit quality of the firm in the valuation of liabilities measured at fair value . the dva calculation methodology is generally consistent with the cva methodology described above and incorporates jpmorgan chase 2019s credit spread as observed through the cds market to estimate the probability of default and loss given default as a result of a systemic event affecting the firm . structured notes dva is estimated using the current fair value of the structured note as the exposure amount , and is otherwise consistent with the derivative dva methodology . 2022 the firm incorporates the impact of funding in its valuation estimates where there is evidence that a market participant in the principal market would incorporate it in a transfer of the instrument . as a result , the fair value of collateralized derivatives is estimated by discounting expected future cash flows at the relevant overnight indexed swap ( 201cois 201d ) rate given the underlying collateral agreement with the counterparty . effective in 2013 , the firm implemented a fva framework to incorporate the impact of funding into its valuation estimates for uncollateralized ( including partially collateralized ) over- the-counter ( 201cotc 201d ) derivatives and structured notes . the firm 2019s fva framework leverages its existing cva and dva calculation methodologies , and considers the fact that the firm 2019s own credit risk is a significant component of funding costs . the key inputs are : ( i ) the expected funding requirements arising from the firm 2019s positions with each counterparty and collateral arrangements ; ( ii ) for assets , the estimated market funding cost in the principal market ; and ( iii ) for liabilities , the hypothetical market funding cost for a transfer to a market participant with a similar credit standing as the firm . upon the implementation of the fva framework in 2013 , the firm recorded a one time $ 1.5 billion loss in principal transactions revenue that was recorded in the cib . while the fva framework applies to both assets and liabilities , the loss on implementation largely related to uncollateralized derivative receivables given that the impact of the firm 2019s own credit risk , which is a significant component of funding costs , was already incorporated in the valuation of liabilities through the application of dva . the following table provides the credit and funding adjustments , excluding the effect of any associated hedging activities , reflected within the consolidated balance sheets as of the dates indicated. . derivative receivables balance ( a ) $ 78975 $ 65759 derivative payables balance ( a ) 71116 57314 derivatives cva ( b ) ( 2674 ) ( 2352 ) derivatives dva and fva ( b ) ( c ) ( 380 ) ( 322 ) structured notes balance ( a ) ( d ) 53772 48808 structured notes dva and fva ( b ) ( e ) 1152 952 ( a ) balances are presented net of applicable cva and dva/fva .

operational requirements of bifurcating the embedded derivatives from the host contracts and accounting for each separately . the hybrid financial instruments are classified as trading account assets

company accounts for mortgage servicing rights ( msrs ) at fair value in accordance with sfas 156 . fair value for msrs is determined using an option-adjusted spread valuation approach . this approach consists of projecting servicing cash flows under multiple interest-rate scenarios and discounting these cash flows using risk-adjusted rates . the model assumptions used in the valuation of msrs include mortgage prepayment speeds and discount rates . the fair value of msrs is primarily affected by changes in prepayments that result from shifts in mortgage interest rates . in managing this risk , the company hedges a significant portion of the values of its msrs through the use of interest-rate derivative contracts , forward- purchase commitments of mortgage-backed securities , and purchased securities classified as trading . see note 23 on page 175 for further discussions regarding the accounting and reporting of msrs . these msrs , which totaled $ 5.7 billion and $ 8.4 billion as of december 31 , 2008 and december 31 , 2007 , respectively , are classified as mortgage servicing rights on citigroup 2019s consolidated balance sheet . changes in fair value of msrs are recorded

with derivative contracts or the proceeds are used to purchase financial assets that will also be accounted for at fair value through earnings . the election has been made to mitigate accounting mismatches and to achieve operational simplifications . these positions are reported in short-term borrowings and long-term debt on the company 2019s consolidated balance sheet . the majority of these non-structured liabilities are a result of the company 2019s election of the fair-value option for liabilities associated with the citi-advised structured investment vehicles ( sivs ) , which were consolidated during the fourth quarter of 2007 . the change in fair values of the sivs 2019 liabilities reported in earnings was $ 2.6 billion for the year ended december 31 , 2008 . for these

elected the fair-value option for certain purchased and originated prime fixed-rate and conforming adjustable-rate first mortgage loans held-for- sale . these loans are intended for sale or securitization and are hedged with derivative instruments . the company has elected the fair-value option to mitigate accounting mismatches in cases where hedge accounting is complex and to achieve operational simplifications . the fair-value option was not elected for loans held-for-investment , as those loans are not hedged with derivative instruments . this election was effective for

. companies maintain both assets and liabilities in local currencies . therefore , foreign exchange rate risk is generally limited to net assets denominated in those foreign currencies . foreign exchange rate risk is reviewed as part of our risk management process . locally required capital levels are invested in home currencies in order to satisfy regulatory require- ments and to support local insurance operations regardless of currency fluctuations . the principal currencies creating foreign exchange risk for us are the british pound sterling , the euro , and the canadian dollar . the following table provides more information on our exposure to foreign exchange rate risk at december 31 , 2008 and 2007. . reinsurance of gmdb and gmib guarantees our net income is directly impacted by changes in the reserves calculated in connection with the reinsurance of variable annuity guarantees , primarily gmdb and gmib . these reserves are calculated in accordance with sop 03-1 ( sop reserves ) and changes in these reserves are reflected as life and annuity benefit expense , which is included in life underwriting income . in addition , our net income is directly impacted by the change in the fair value of the gmib liability ( fvl ) , which is classified as a derivative according to fas 133 . the fair value liability established for a gmib reinsurance contract represents the differ- ence between the fair value of the contract and the sop 03-1 reserves . changes in the fair value of the gmib liability , net of associated changes in the calculated sop 03-1 reserve , are reflected as realized gains or losses . ace views our variable annuity reinsurance business as having a similar risk profile to that of catastrophe reinsurance , with the probability of long-term economic loss relatively small at the time of pricing . adverse changes in market factors and policyholder behavior will have an impact on both life underwriting income and net income . when evaluating these risks , we expect to be compensated for taking both the risk of a cumulative long-term economic net loss , as well as the short-term accounting variations caused by these market movements . therefore , we evaluate this business in terms of its long-term eco- nomic risk and reward . the ultimate risk to the variable annuity guaranty reinsurance business is a long-term underperformance of investment returns , which can be exacerbated by a long-term reduction in interest rates . following a market downturn , continued market underperformance over a period of five to seven years would eventually result in a higher level of paid claims as policyholders accessed their guarantees through death or annuitization . however , if market conditions improved following a downturn , sop 03-1 reserves and fair value liability would fall reflecting a decreased likelihood of future claims , which would result in an increase in both life underwriting income and net income . as of december 31 , 2008 , management established the sop 03-1 reserve based on the benefit ratio calculated using actual market values at december 31 , 2008 . management exercises judgment in determining the extent to which short-term market movements impact the sop 03-1 reserve . the sop 03-1 reserve is based on the calculation of a long-term benefit ratio ( or loss ratio ) for the variable annuity guarantee reinsurance . despite the long-term nature of the risk the benefit ratio calculation is impacted by short-term market movements that may be judged by management to be temporary or transient . management will , in keeping with the language in sop 03-1 , regularly examine both quantitative and qualitative analysis and management will determine if , in its judgment , the change in the calculated benefit ratio is of sufficient magnitude and has persisted for a sufficient duration to warrant a change in the benefit ratio used to establish the sop 03-1 reserve . this has no impact on either premium received or claims paid nor does it impact the long-term profit or loss of the variable annuity guaran- tee reinsurance . the sop 03-1 reserve and fair value liability calculations are directly affected by market factors , including equity levels , interest rate levels , credit risk and implied volatilities , as well as policyholder behaviors , such as annuitization and lapse rates . the table below shows the sensitivity , as of december 31 , 2008 , of the sop 03-1 reserves and fair value liability associated with the variable annuity guarantee reinsurance portfolio . in addition , the tables below show the sensitivity of the fair value of specific derivative instruments held ( hedge value ) , which includes instruments purchased in january 2009 , to partially offset the risk in the variable annuity guarantee reinsurance portfolio . although these derivatives do not receive hedge accounting treatment , some portion of the change in value may be used to offset changes in the sop 03-1 reserve. . the fair value of net assets denominated in foreign currencies of 2008 is $ 1127 ; the fair value of net assets denominated in foreign currencies of 2007 is $ 1651 ;the percentage of fair value of total net assets of 2008 is 7.8% ( 7.8 % ) ; the percentage of fair value of total net assets of 2007 is 9.9% ( 9.9 % ) ;the pre-tax impact on equity of

while individual securities have varying durations , as of may 31 , 2014 the average duration of our short-term investments and cash equivalents portfolio was 126 days . to date we have not experienced difficulty accessing the credit markets or incurred higher interest costs . future volatility in the capital markets , however , may increase costs associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments or affect our ability to access those markets . we believe that existing cash , cash equivalents , short-term investments , and cash generated by operations , together with access to external sources of funds as described above , will be sufficient to meet our domestic and foreign capital needs in the foreseeable future . we utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies to manage our worldwide cash and deploy funds to locations where they are needed . we routinely repatriate a portion of our foreign earnings for which u.s . taxes have previously been provided . we also indefinitely reinvest a significant portion of our foreign earnings , and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these earnings . should we require additional capital in the united states , we may elect to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign funds or raise capital in the united states through debt . if we were to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign funds , we would be required to accrue and pay additional u.s . taxes less applicable foreign tax credits . if we elect to raise capital in the united states through debt , we would incur additional interest expense . off-balance sheet arrangements in connection with various contracts and agreements , we routinely provide indemnification relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights , coverage for legal issues that arise and other items where we are acting as the guarantor . currently , we have several such agreements in place . however , based on our historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss , we have determined that the fair value of such indemnification is not material to our financial position or results of operations . contractual obligations our significant long-term contractual obligations as of may 31 , 2014 and significant endorsement contracts entered into through the date of this report are as follows: . ( 1 ) the cash payments due for long-term debt include estimated interest payments . estimates of interest payments are based on outstanding principal amounts , applicable fixed interest rates or currently effective interest rates as of may 31 , 2014 ( if variable ) , timing of scheduled payments , and the term of the debt obligations . ( 2 ) the amounts listed for endorsement contracts represent approximate amounts of base compensation and minimum guaranteed royalty fees we are obligated to pay athlete and sport team endorsers of our products . actual payments under some contracts may be higher than the amounts listed as these contracts provide for bonuses to be paid to the endorsers based upon athletic achievements and/or royalties on product sales in future periods . actual payments under some contracts may also be lower as these contracts include provisions for reduced payments if athletic performance declines in future periods . in addition to the cash payments , we are obligated to furnish our endorsers with nike product for their use . it is not possible to determine how much we will spend on this product on an annual basis as the contracts generally do not stipulate a specific amount of cash to be spent on the product . the amount of product provided to the endorsers will depend on many factors , including general playing conditions , the number of sporting events in which they participate , and our own decisions regarding product and marketing initiatives . in addition , the costs to design , develop , source , and purchase the products furnished to the endorsers are incurred over a period of time and are not necessarily tracked separately from similar costs incurred for products sold to customers . ( 3 ) we generally order product at least four to five months in advance of sale based primarily on futures orders received from customers . the amounts listed for product purchase obligations represent agreements ( including open purchase orders ) to purchase products in the ordinary course of business that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms . in some cases , prices are subject to change throughout the production process . the reported amounts exclude product purchase liabilities included in accounts payable on the consolidated balance sheet as of may 31 , 2014 . ( 4 ) other amounts primarily include service and marketing commitments made in the ordinary course of business . the amounts represent the minimum payments required by legally binding contracts and agreements that specify all significant terms , including open purchase orders for non-product purchases . the reported amounts exclude those liabilities included in accounts payable or accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of may 31 , 2014 . nike , inc . 2014 annual report and notice of annual meeting 79 . the operating leases of description of commitment 2015 is $ 427 ; the operating leases of description of commitment 2016 is $ 399 ; the operating leases of description of commitment 2017 is $ 366 ; the operating leases of description of commitment 2018 is $ 311 ; the operating leases of description of commitment 2019 is $ 251 ; the operating leases of description of commitment thereafter is $ 1050 ; the operating leases of total is $ 2804 ;the capital leases of description of commitment 2015 is 36 ; the capital leases of description of commitment 2016 is 35 ; the capital leases of description of commitment 2017 is 1 ; the capital leases of description of commitment 2018 is 1 ; the capital leases of description of commitment 2019 is 1 ; the capital leases of description of commitment thereafter is 2014 ; the capital leases of total is 74 ;the long-term debt ( 1 ) of description of commitment 2015 is 46 ; the long-term debt ( 1 ) of description of commitment 2016 is 145 ; the long-term debt ( 1 ) of description of commitment 2017 is 79 ; the long-term debt ( 1 ) of description of commitment 2018 is 56 ; the long-term debt ( 1 ) of description of commitment 2019 is 37 ; the long-term debt ( 1 ) of description of commitment thereafter is 1488 ; the long-term debt ( 1 ) of total is 1851 ;the endorsement contracts ( 2 ) of description of commitment 2015 is 991 ; the endorsement contracts ( 2 ) of description of commitment 2016 is 787 ; the endorsement contracts ( 2 ) of description of commitment 2017 is 672 ; the endorsement contracts ( 2 ) of description of commitment 2018 is 524 ; the endorsement contracts ( 2 ) of description of commitment 2019 is 349 ; the endorsement contracts ( 2 ) of description of commitment thereafter is 1381 ; the endorsement contracts ( 2 ) of total is 4704 ;the product purchase obligations ( 3 ) of description of commitment 2015 is 3688 ; the product purchase obligations ( 3 ) of description of commitment 2016 is 2014 ; the product purchase obligations ( 3 ) of description of commitment 2017 is 2014 ; the product purchase obligations ( 3 ) of description of commitment 2018 is 2014 ; the product purchase obligations ( 3 ) of description of commitment 2019 is 2014 ; the product purchase obligations ( 3 ) of description of commitment thereafter is 2014 ; the product purchase obligations ( 3 ) of total is 3688 ;the other ( 4 ) of description of commitment 2015 is 309 ; the other ( 4 ) of description of commitment 2016 is 108 ; the other ( 4 ) of description of commitment 2017 is 78 ; the other ( 4 ) of description of commitment 2018 is 7 ; the other ( 4 ) of description of commitment 2019 is 3 ; the other ( 4 ) of description of commitment thereafter is 12 ; the other ( 4 ) of total is 517 ;the total of description of commitment 2015 is $ 5497 ; the total of description of commitment 2016 is $ 1474 ; the total of description of commitment 2017 is $ 1196 ; the total of description of commitment 2018 is $ 899 ; the total of description of commitment 2019 is $ 641 ; the total of description of commitment thereafter is $ 3931 ; the total of total is $ 13638 ;",

earnings were $ 11.65 billion for 2016 , 8% ( 8 % ) lower than 2015 , reflecting a decrease in net revenues and the impact of expense savings initiatives . the ratio of compensation and benefits to net revenues for 2016 was 38.1% ( 38.1 % ) compared with 37.5% ( 37.5 % ) for 2015 . non-compensation expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings were $ 8.66 billion for 2016 , 30% ( 30 % ) lower than 2015 , primarily due to significantly lower net provisions for mortgage-related litigation and regulatory matters , which are included in other expenses . in addition , market development expenses and professional fees were lower compared with 2015 , reflecting expense savings initiatives . net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings for 2016 were $ 396 million compared

reduced to fund this charitable contribution to goldman sachs gives . we ask our participating managing directors to make recommendations regarding potential charitable recipients for this contribution . as of december 2016 , total staff decreased 7% ( 7 % ) compared with december 2015 , due to expense savings initiatives . provision for taxes the effective income tax rate for 2017 was 61.5% ( 61.5 % ) , up from 28.2% ( 28.2 % ) for 2016 . the increase compared with 2016 reflected the estimated impact of tax legislation , which was enacted on december 22 , 2017 and , among other things , lowers u.s . corporate income tax rates as of january 1 , 2018 , implements a territorial tax system and imposes a repatriation tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries . the estimated impact of tax legislation was an increase in income tax expense of $ 4.40 billion , of which $ 3.32 billion was due to the repatriation tax and $ 1.08 billion was due to the effects of the implementation of the territorial tax system and the remeasurement of u.s . deferred tax assets at lower enacted corporate tax rates . the impact of tax legislation may differ from this estimate , possibly materially , due to , among other things , ( i ) refinement of our calculations based on updated information , ( ii ) changes in interpretations and assumptions , ( iii ) guidance that may be issued and ( iv ) actions we may take as a result of tax legislation . excluding the estimated impact of tax legislation , the effective income tax rate for 2017 was 22.0% ( 22.0 % ) , down from 28.2% ( 28.2 % ) for 2016 . this decrease was primarily due to tax benefits on the settlement of employee share-based awards in accordance with asu no . 2016-09 . the impact of these settlements in 2017 was a reduction to our provision for taxes of $ 719 million and a reduction in our effective income tax rate of 6.4 percentage points . see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about this asu . the effective income tax rate , excluding the estimated impact of tax legislation , is a non-gaap measure and may not be comparable to similar non-gaap measures used by other companies . we believe that presenting our effective income tax rate , excluding the estimated impact of tax legislation is meaningful , as excluding this item increases the comparability of period-to-period results . the table below presents the calculation of the effective income tax rate , excluding the estimated impact of tax legislation. . excluding the estimated impact of tax legislation $ 11132 $ 2446 22.0% ( 22.0 % ) the effective income tax rate for 2016 was 28.2% ( 28.2 % ) , down from 30.7% ( 30.7 % ) for 2015 . the decline compared with 2015 was primarily due to the impact of non-deductible provisions for mortgage-related litigation and regulatory matters in 2015 , partially offset by the impact of changes in tax law on deferred tax assets , the mix of earnings and an increase related to higher enacted tax rates impacting certain of our u.k . subsidiaries in 2016 . effective january 1 , 2018 , tax legislation reduced the u.s . corporate tax rate to 21 percent , eliminated tax deductions for certain expenses and enacted two new taxes , base erosion and anti-abuse tax ( beat ) and global intangible low taxed income ( gilti ) . beat is an alternative minimum tax that applies to banks that pay more than 2 percent of total deductible expenses to certain foreign subsidiaries . gilti is a 10.5 percent tax , before allowable credits for foreign taxes

( a ) reflects additional capital required , in the firm 2019s view , to meet its regulatory and debt rating objectives . credit risk capital credit risk capital is estimated separately for the wholesale businesses ( cib , cb and am ) and consumer business ( ccb ) . credit risk capital for the wholesale credit portfolio is defined in terms of unexpected credit losses , both from defaults and from declines in the value of the portfolio due to credit deterioration , measured over a one-year period at a confidence level consistent with an 201caa 201d credit rating standard . unexpected losses are losses in excess of those for which the allowance for credit losses is maintained . the capital methodology is based on several principal drivers of credit risk : exposure at default ( or loan-equivalent amount ) , default likelihood , credit spreads , loss severity and portfolio correlation . credit risk capital for the consumer portfolio is based on product and other relevant risk segmentation . actual segment-level default and severity experience are used to estimate unexpected losses for a one-year horizon at a confidence level consistent with an 201caa 201d credit rating standard . the decrease in credit risk capital in 2012 was driven by consumer portfolio runoff and continued model enhancements to better estimate future stress credit losses in the consumer portfolio . see credit risk management on pages 134 2013135 of this annual report for more information about these credit risk measures . market risk capital the firm calculates market risk capital guided by the principle that capital should reflect the risk of loss in the value of the portfolios and financial instruments caused by adverse movements in market variables , such as interest and foreign exchange rates , credit spreads , and securities and commodities prices , taking into account the liquidity of the financial instruments . results from daily var , weekly stress tests , issuer credit spreads and default risk calculations , as well as other factors , are used to determine appropriate capital levels . market risk capital is allocated to each business segment based on its risk assessment . the increase in market risk capital in 2012 was driven by increased risk in the synthetic credit portfolio . see market risk management on pages 163 2013169 of this annual report for more information about these market risk measures . operational risk capital operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed processes or systems , human factors or external events . the operational risk capital model is based on actual losses and potential scenario-based losses , with adjustments to the capital calculation to reflect changes in the quality of the control environment . the increase in operational risk capital in 2012 was primarily due to continued model enhancements to better capture large historical loss events , including mortgage-related litigation costs . the increases that occurred during 2012 will be fully reflected in average operational risk capital in 2013 . see operational risk management on pages 175 2013176 of this annual report for more information about operational risk . private equity risk capital capital is allocated to privately- and publicly-held securities , third-party fund investments , and commitments in the private equity portfolio , within the corporate/private equity segment , to cover the potential loss associated with a decline in equity markets and related asset devaluations . in addition to negative market fluctuations , potential losses in private equity investment portfolios can be magnified by liquidity risk. . the credit risk of yearly average 2012 is $ 46.6 ; the credit risk of yearly average 2011 is $ 48.2 ; the credit risk of yearly average 2010 is $ 49.7 ;the market risk of yearly average 2012 is 17.5 ; the market risk of yearly average 2011 is 14.5 ; the market risk of yearly average 2010 is 15.1 ;the operational risk of yearly average 2012 is 15.9 ; the operational risk of yearly average 2011 is 8.5 ; the operational risk of yearly average 2010 is 7.4 ;the private equity risk of yearly average 2012 is 6.0 ; the private equity risk of yearly average 2011 is 6.9 ; the private equity risk of yearly average 2010 is 6.2 ;the economic risk capital of yearly average 2012 is 86.0 ; the economic risk capital of yearly average 2011 is 78.1 ; the economic risk capital of yearly average 2010 is 78.4 ;the goodwill of yearly average 2012 is 48.2 ; the goodwill of yearly average 2011 is 48.6 ; the goodwill of yearly average 2010 is 48.6 ;the other ( a ) of yearly average 2012 is 50.2 ; the other ( a ) of yearly average 2011 is 46.6 ; the other ( a ) of yearly average 2010 is 34.5 ;the total common stockholders 2019equity of yearly average 2012 is $ 184.4 ; the total common stockholders 2019equity of yearly average 2011 is $ 173.3 ; the total common stockholders 2019equity of yearly average 2010 is $ 161.5 ;",

be used to support the dta . the major components of the u.s . federal dta are $ 10.5 billion in foreign tax-credit carryforwards , $ 4.6 billion in a net-operating-loss carryforward , $ 0.6 billion in a general-business-credit carryforward , $ 19.9 billion in net deductions that have not yet been taken on a tax return , and $ 0.9 billion in compensation deductions , which reduced additional paid-in capital in january 2009 and for which sfas 123 ( r ) did not permit any adjustment to such dta at december 31 , 2008 because the related stock compensation was not yet deductible to the

shares outstanding used to compute earnings per common share were as follows ( in millions ) : . we compute basic and diluted earnings per common share by dividing net earnings by the respective weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the periods presented . our calculation of diluted earnings per common share also includes the dilutive effects for the assumed vesting of outstanding restricted stock units ( rsus ) , performance stock units ( psus ) and exercise of outstanding stock options based on the treasury stock method . there were no significant anti-dilutive equity awards for the years ended december 31 , 2018 , 2017 and 2016 . note 3 2013 acquisition and divestitures consolidation of awe management limited on august 24 , 2016 , we increased our ownership interest in the awe joint venture , which operates the united kingdom 2019s nuclear deterrent program , from 33% ( 33 % ) to 51% ( 51 % ) . consequently , we began consolidating awe and our operating results include 100% ( 100 % ) of awe 2019s sales and 51% ( 51 % ) of its operating profit . prior to increasing our ownership interest , we accounted for our investment in awe using the equity method of accounting . under the equity method , we recognized only 33% ( 33 % ) of awe 2019s earnings or losses and no sales . accordingly , prior to august 24 , 2016 , the date we obtained control , we recorded 33% ( 33 % ) of awe 2019s net earnings in our operating results and subsequent to august 24 , 2016 , we recognized 100% ( 100 % ) of awe 2019s sales and 51% ( 51 % ) of its operating profit . we accounted for this transaction as a 201cstep acquisition 201d ( as defined by u.s . gaap ) , which requires us to consolidate and record the assets and liabilities of awe at fair value . accordingly , we recorded intangible assets of $ 243 million related to customer relationships , $ 32 million of net liabilities , and noncontrolling interests of $ 107 million . the intangible assets are being amortized over a period of eight years in accordance with the underlying pattern of economic benefit reflected by the future net cash flows . in 2016 , we recognized a non-cash net gain of $ 104 million associated with obtaining a controlling interest in awe , which consisted of a $ 127 million pretax gain recognized in the operating results of our space business segment and $ 23 million of tax-related items at our corporate office . the gain represented the fair value of our 51% ( 51 % ) interest in awe , less the carrying value of our previously held investment in awe and deferred taxes . the gain was recorded in other income , net on our consolidated statements of earnings . the fair value of awe ( including the intangible assets ) , our controlling interest , and the noncontrolling interests were determined using the income approach . divestiture of the information systems & global solutions business on august 16 , 2016 , we divested our former is&gs business , which merged with leidos , in a reverse morris trust transaction ( the 201ctransaction 201d ) . the transaction was completed in a multi-step process pursuant to which we initially contributed the is&gs business to abacus innovations corporation ( abacus ) , a wholly owned subsidiary of lockheed martin created to facilitate the transaction , and the common stock of abacus was distributed to participating lockheed martin stockholders through an exchange offer . under the terms of the exchange offer , lockheed martin stockholders had the option to exchange shares of lockheed martin common stock for shares of abacus common stock . at the conclusion of the exchange offer , all shares of abacus common stock were exchanged for 9369694 shares of lockheed martin common stock held by lockheed martin stockholders that elected to participate in the exchange . the shares of lockheed martin common stock that were exchanged and accepted were retired , reducing the number of shares of our common stock outstanding by approximately 3% ( 3 % ) . following the exchange offer , abacus merged with a subsidiary of leidos , with abacus continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of leidos . as part of the merger , each share of abacus common stock was automatically converted into one share of leidos common stock . we did not receive any shares of leidos common stock as part of the transaction and do not hold any shares of leidos or abacus common stock following the transaction . based on an opinion of outside tax counsel , subject to customary qualifications and based on factual representations , the exchange offer and merger will qualify as tax-free transactions to lockheed martin and its stockholders , except to the extent that cash was paid to lockheed martin stockholders in lieu of fractional shares . in connection with the transaction , abacus borrowed an aggregate principal amount of approximately $ 1.84 billion under term loan facilities with third party financial institutions , the proceeds of which were used to make a one-time special cash payment of $ 1.80 billion to lockheed martin and to pay associated borrowing fees and expenses . the entire special cash payment was used to repay debt , pay dividends and repurchase stock during the third and fourth quarters of 2016 . the obligations under the abacus term loan facilities were guaranteed by leidos as part of the transaction. . the weighted average common shares outstanding for basic computations of 2018 is 284.5 ; the weighted average common shares outstanding for basic computations of 2017 is 287.8 ; the weighted average common shares outstanding for basic computations of 2016 is 299.3 ;the weighted average dilutive effect of equity awards of

    "prompt": "by what percentage did the fair value decrease from 2010 to 2011?\ninterest-earning assets including unearned income in the accretion of fair value adjustments on discounts recognized on acquired or purchased loans is recognized based on the constant effective yield of the financial instrument . the timing and amount of revenue that we recognize in any period is dependent on estimates , judgments , assumptions , and interpretation of contractual terms . changes in these factors can have a significant impact on revenue recognized in any period due to changes in products , market conditions or industry norms . residential and commercial mortgage servicing rights we elect to measure our residential mortgage servicing rights ( msrs ) at fair value . this election was made to be consistent with our risk management strategy to hedge changes in the fair value of these assets as described below . the fair value of residential msrs is estimated by using a cash flow valuation model which calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing cash flows , taking into consideration actual and expected mortgage loan prepayment rates , discount rates , servicing costs , and other economic factors which are determined based on current market conditions . assumptions incorporated into the residential msrs valuation model reflect management 2019s best estimate of factors that a market participant would use in valuing the residential msrs . although sales of residential msrs do occur , residential msrs do not trade in an active market with readily observable prices so the precise terms and conditions of sales are not available . as a benchmark for the reasonableness of its residential msrs fair value , pnc obtains opinions of value from independent parties ( 201cbrokers 201d ) . these brokers provided a range ( +/- 10 bps ) based upon their own discounted cash flow calculations of our portfolio that reflected conditions in the secondary market , and any recently executed servicing transactions . pnc compares its internally-developed residential msrs value to the ranges of values received from the brokers . if our residential msrs fair value falls outside of the brokers 2019 ranges , management will assess whether a valuation adjustment is warranted . for 2011 and 2010 , pnc 2019s residential msrs value has not fallen outside of the brokers 2019 ranges . we consider our residential msrs value to represent a reasonable estimate of fair value . commercial msrs are purchased or originated when loans are sold with servicing retained . commercial msrs do not trade in an active market with readily observable prices so the precise terms and conditions of sales are not available . commercial msrs are initially recorded at fair value and are subsequently accounted for at the lower of amortized cost or fair value . commercial msrs are periodically evaluated for impairment . for purposes of impairment , the commercial mortgage servicing rights are stratified based on asset type , which characterizes the predominant risk of the underlying financial asset . the fair value of commercial msrs is estimated by using an internal valuation model . the model calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing cash flows considering estimates of servicing revenue and costs , discount rates and prepayment speeds . pnc employs risk management strategies designed to protect the value of msrs from changes in interest rates and related market factors . residential msrs values are economically hedged with securities and derivatives , including interest-rate swaps , options , and forward mortgage-backed and futures contracts . as interest rates change , these financial instruments are expected to have changes in fair value negatively correlated to the change in fair value of the hedged residential msrs portfolio . the hedge relationships are actively managed in response to changing market conditions over the life of the residential msrs assets . commercial msrs are economically hedged at a macro level or with specific derivatives to protect against a significant decline in interest rates . selecting appropriate financial instruments to economically hedge residential or commercial msrs requires significant management judgment to assess how mortgage rates and prepayment speeds could affect the future values of msrs . hedging results can frequently be less predictable in the short term , but over longer periods of time are expected to protect the economic value of the msrs . the fair value of residential and commercial msrs and significant inputs to the valuation model as of december 31 , 2011 are shown in the tables below . the expected and actual rates of mortgage loan prepayments are significant factors driving the fair value . management uses a third-party model to estimate future residential loan prepayments and internal proprietary models to estimate future commercial loan prepayments . these models have been refined based on current market conditions . future interest rates are another important factor in the valuation of msrs . management utilizes market implied forward interest rates to estimate the future direction of mortgage and discount rates . the forward rates utilized are derived from the current yield curve for u.s . dollar interest rate swaps and are consistent with pricing of capital markets instruments . changes in the shape and slope of the forward curve in future periods may result in volatility in the fair value estimate . residential mortgage servicing rights dollars in millions december 31 december 31 . weighted-average constant prepayment rate ( a ) 22.10% ( 22.10 % ) 12.61% ( 12.61 % )

    "prompt": "what was the percentage increase in the net outflows from 2016 to 2017\nliquidity monitoring and measurement stress testing liquidity stress testing is performed for each of citi 2019s major entities , operating subsidiaries and/or countries . stress testing and scenario analyses are intended to quantify the potential impact of an adverse liquidity event on the balance sheet and liquidity position , and to identify viable funding alternatives that can be utilized . these scenarios include assumptions about significant changes in key funding sources , market triggers ( such as credit ratings ) , potential uses of funding and geopolitical and macroeconomic conditions . these conditions include expected and stressed market conditions as well as company-specific events . liquidity stress tests are conducted to ascertain potential mismatches between liquidity sources and uses over a variety of time horizons and over different stressed conditions . liquidity limits are set accordingly . to monitor the liquidity of an entity , these stress tests and potential mismatches are calculated with varying frequencies , with several tests performed daily . given the range of potential stresses , citi maintains contingency funding plans on a consolidated basis and for individual entities . these plans specify a wide range of readily available actions for a variety of adverse market conditions or idiosyncratic stresses . short-term liquidity measurement : liquidity coverage ratio ( lcr ) in addition to internal liquidity stress metrics that citi has developed for a 30-day stress scenario , citi also monitors its liquidity by reference to the lcr , as calculated pursuant to the u.s . lcr rules . generally , the lcr is designed to ensure that banks maintain an adequate level of hqla to meet liquidity needs under an acute 30-day stress scenario . the lcr is calculated by dividing hqla by estimated net outflows over a stressed 30-day period , with the net outflows determined by applying prescribed outflow factors to various categories of liabilities , such as deposits , unsecured and secured wholesale borrowings , unused lending commitments and derivatives- related exposures , partially offset by inflows from assets maturing within 30 days . banks are required to calculate an add-on to address potential maturity mismatches between contractual cash outflows and inflows within the 30-day period in determining the total amount of net outflows . the minimum lcr requirement is 100% ( 100 % ) , effective january 2017 . pursuant to the federal reserve board 2019s final rule regarding lcr disclosures , effective april 1 , 2017 , citi began to disclose lcr in the prescribed format . the table below sets forth the components of citi 2019s lcr calculation and hqla in excess of net outflows for the periods indicated : in billions of dollars dec . 31 , sept . 30 , dec . 31 . note : amounts set forth in the table above are presented on an average basis . as set forth in the table above , citi 2019s lcr increased year- over-year , as the increase in the hqla ( as discussed above ) more than offset an increase in modeled net outflows . the increase in modeled net outflows was primarily driven by changes in assumptions , including changes in methodology to better align citi 2019s outflow assumptions with those embedded in its resolution planning . sequentially , citi 2019s lcr remained unchanged . long-term liquidity measurement : net stable funding ratio ( nsfr ) in 2016 , the federal reserve board , the fdic and the occ issued a proposed rule to implement the basel iii nsfr requirement . the u.s.-proposed nsfr is largely consistent with the basel committee 2019s final nsfr rules . in general , the nsfr assesses the availability of a bank 2019s stable funding against a required level . a bank 2019s available stable funding would include portions of equity , deposits and long-term debt , while its required stable funding would be based on the liquidity characteristics of its assets , derivatives and commitments . prescribed factors would be required to be applied to the various categories of asset and liabilities classes . the ratio of available stable funding to required stable funding would be required to be greater than 100% ( 100 % ) . while citi believes that it is compliant with the proposed u.s . nsfr rules as of december 31 , 2017 , it will need to evaluate a final version of the rules , which are expected to be released during 2018 . citi expects that the nsfr final rules implementation period will be communicated along with the final version of the rules. . the hqla of dec . 31 2017 is $ 446.4 ;

    "prompt": "what is the total estimated amortization loss for 2016?\nloss on the contract may be recorded , if necessary , and any remaining deferred implementation revenues would typically be recognized over the remaining service period through the termination date . in connection with our long-term outsourcing service agreements , highly customized implementation efforts are often necessary to set up clients and their human resource or benefit programs on our systems and operating processes . for outsourcing services sold separately or accounted for as a separate unit of accounting , specific , incremental and direct costs of implementation incurred prior to the services commencing are generally deferred and amortized over the period that the related ongoing services revenue is recognized . deferred costs are assessed for recoverability on a periodic basis to the extent the deferred cost exceeds related deferred revenue . pensions we sponsor defined benefit pension plans throughout the world . our most significant plans are located in the u.s. , the u.k. , the netherlands and canada . our significant u.s. , u.k. , netherlands and canadian pension plans are closed to new entrants . we have ceased crediting future benefits relating to salary and service for our u.s. , u.k. , netherlands and canadian plans to the extent statutorily permitted . in 2016 , we estimate pension and post-retirement net periodic benefit cost for major plans to increase by $ 15 million to a benefit of approximately $ 54 million . the increase in the benefit is primarily due to a change in our approach to measuring service and interest cost . effective december 31 , 2015 and for 2016 expense , we have elected to utilize a full yield curve approach in the estimation of the service and interest cost components of net periodic pension and post-retirement benefit cost for our major pension and other post-retirement benefit plans by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows . in 2015 and prior years , we estimated these components of net periodic pension and post-retirement benefit cost by applying a single weighted-average discount rate , derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period . we have made this change to improve the correlation between projected benefit cash flows and the corresponding yield curve spot rates and to provide a more precise measurement of service and interest costs . this change does not affect the measurement of the projected benefit obligation as the change in the service cost and interest cost is completely offset in the actuarial ( gain ) loss recorded in other comprehensive income . we accounted for this change as a change in estimate and , accordingly , will account for it prospectively . recognition of gains and losses and prior service certain changes in the value of the obligation and in the value of plan assets , which may occur due to various factors such as changes in the discount rate and actuarial assumptions , actual demographic experience and/or plan asset performance are not immediately recognized in net income . such changes are recognized in other comprehensive income and are amortized into net income as part of the net periodic benefit cost . unrecognized gains and losses that have been deferred in other comprehensive income , as previously described , are amortized into compensation and benefits expense as a component of periodic pension expense based on the average life expectancy of the u.s. , the netherlands , canada , and u.k . plan members . we amortize any prior service expense or credits that arise as a result of plan changes over a period consistent with the amortization of gains and losses . as of december 31 , 2015 , our pension plans have deferred losses that have not yet been recognized through income in the consolidated financial statements . we amortize unrecognized actuarial losses outside of a corridor , which is defined as 10% ( 10 % ) of the greater of market-related value of plan assets or projected benefit obligation . to the extent not offset by future gains , incremental amortization as calculated above will continue to affect future pension expense similarly until fully amortized . the following table discloses our unrecognized actuarial gains and losses , the number of years over which we are amortizing the experience loss , and the estimated 2016 amortization of loss by country ( amounts in millions ) : . the unrecognized prior service cost ( income ) at december 31 , 2015 was $ 9 million , $ 46 million , and $ ( 7 ) million in the u.s. , u.k . and other plans , respectively . for the u.s . pension plans we use a market-related valuation of assets approach to determine the expected return on assets , which is a component of net periodic benefit cost recognized in the consolidated statements of income . this approach . the unrecognized actuarial gains and losses of u.k . is $ 1511 ; the unrecognized actuarial gains and losses of u.s . is $ 1732 ; the unrecognized actuarial gains and losses of other is $ 382 ;the amortization period ( in years ) of u.k . is 10 - 32 ; the amortization period ( in years ) of u.s . is 7 - 28 ; the amortization period ( in years ) of other is 15 - 41 ;the estimated 2016 amortization of loss of u.k . is $ 37 ; the estimated 2016 amortization of loss of u.s . is $ 52 ; the estimated 2016 amortization of loss

identified in 2007 , and issues associated with non-nuclear weld inspection and the installation of weapons handling equipment on certain submarines , and certain purchased material quality issues identified in 2009 . the company does not believe that resolution of these issues will have a material effect upon its consolidated financial position , results of operations or cash flows . environmental matters 2014the estimated cost to complete environmental remediation has been accrued where it is probable that the company will incur such costs in the future to address environmental conditions at currently or formerly owned or leased operating facilities , or at sites where it has been named a potentially responsible party ( 201cprp 201d ) by the environmental protection agency , or similarly designated by another environmental agency , and these costs can be estimated by management . these accruals do not include any litigation costs related to environmental matters , nor do they include amounts recorded as asset retirement obligations . to assess the potential impact on the company 2019s consolidated financial statements , management estimates the range of reasonably possible remediation costs that could be incurred by the company , taking into account currently available facts on each site as well as the current state of technology and prior experience in remediating contaminated sites . these estimates are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect changes in facts and technical and legal circumstances . management estimates that as of december 31 , 2011 , the probable future costs for environmental remediation is $ 3 million , which is accrued in other current liabilities . factors that could result in changes to the company 2019s estimates include : modification of planned remedial actions , increases or decreases in the estimated time required to remediate , changes to the determination of legally responsible parties , discovery of more extensive contamination than anticipated , changes in laws and regulations affecting remediation requirements , and improvements in remediation technology . should other prps not pay their allocable share of remediation costs , the company may have to incur costs exceeding those already estimated and accrued . in addition , there are certain potential remediation sites where the costs of remediation cannot be reasonably estimated . although management cannot predict whether new information gained as projects progress will materially affect the estimated liability accrued , management does not believe that future remediation expenditures will have a material effect on the company 2019s consolidated financial position , results of operations or cash flows . financial

presented , the company and u.s . government representatives engage in discussions to enable hii to evaluate the merits of these claims as well as to assess the amounts being claimed . the company does not believe that the outcome of any such matters will have a material effect on its consolidated financial position , results of operations or cash flows . collective bargaining agreements 2014the company believes that it maintains good relations with its approximately 38000 employees of which approximately 50% ( 50 % ) are covered by a total of 10 collective bargaining agreements . the company expects to renegotiate renewals of each of its collective bargaining agreements between 2013 and 2015 as they approach expiration . collective bargaining agreements generally expire after

( a ) the table shows the impact of consolidating the assets and liabilities of the multi- seller conduits at their current carrying value ; as such , there would be no income statement or capital impact at the date of consolidation . if the firm were required to consolidate the assets and liabilities of the conduits at fair value , the tier 1 capital ratio would be approximately 10.8% ( 10.8 % ) . the fair value of the assets is primarily based upon pricing for comparable transactions . the fair value of these assets could change significantly because the pricing of conduit transactions is renegotiated with the client , generally , on an annual basis and due to changes in current market conditions . ( b ) consolidation is assumed to occur on the first day of the quarter , at the quarter-end levels , in order to provide a meaningful adjustment to average assets in the denomi- nator of the leverage ratio . the firm could fund purchases of assets from vies should it become necessary . 2007 activity in july 2007 , a reverse repurchase agreement collateralized by prime residential mortgages held by a firm-administered multi-seller conduit was put to jpmorgan chase under its deal-specific liquidity facility . the asset was transferred to and recorded by jpmorgan chase at its par value based on the fair value of the collateral that supported the reverse repurchase agreement . during the fourth quarter of 2007 , additional information regarding the value of the collateral , including performance statistics , resulted in the determi- nation by the firm that the fair value of the collateral was impaired . impairment losses were allocated to the eln holder ( the party that absorbs the majority of the expected loss from the conduit ) in accor- dance with the contractual provisions of the eln note . on october 29 , 2007 , certain structured cdo assets originated in the second quarter of 2007 and backed by subprime mortgages were transferred to the firm from two firm-administered multi-seller conduits . it became clear in october that commercial paper investors and rating agencies were becoming increasingly concerned about cdo assets backed by subprime mortgage exposures . because of these concerns , and to ensure the continuing viability of the two conduits as financing vehicles for clients and as investment alternatives for commercial paper investors , the firm , in its role as administrator , transferred the cdo assets out of the multi-seller con- duits . the structured cdo assets were transferred to the firm at . the assets of reported is $ 2175.1 ; the assets of pro forma ( a ) ( b ) is $ 2218.2 ;the liabilities of reported is 2008.2 ; the liabilities of pro forma ( a ) ( b ) is 2051.3 ;the tier 1 capital ratio of reported is 10.9% ( 10.9 % ) ; the tier 1 capital ratio of pro forma ( a ) ( b ) is 10.9% ( 10.9 % ) ;the tier 1 leverage ratio of reported is 6.9 ; the tier 1 leverage ratio of pro forma ( a ) ( b ) is 6.8 ;",

trading day imme- diately following the day the debentures are tendered for conversion ( the 201cten-day weighted average price 201d ) . the company will deliver the conversion value to holders as follows : ( 1 ) an amount in cash ( the 201cprincipal return 201d ) equal to the lesser of ( a ) the aggregate conversion value of the debentures to be converted and ( b ) the aggregate principal amount of the debentures to be converted , and ( 2 ) if the aggregate conversion value of the debentures to be converted is greater than the principal return , an amount in shares ( the 201cnet shares 201d ) , determined as set forth below , equal to such aggregate conversion value less the principal return ( the 201cnet share amount 201d ) . the number of net shares to be paid will be determined by dividing the net share amount by the ten-day weighted average price . in lieu of delivering fractional shares , the company will deliver cash based on the ten-day weighted average price . the

of cash flow projected to be generated over the remaining economic life of the asset or liability being measured . both the amount and the duration of the cash flows are considered from a market participant perspective . our estimates of market participant net cash flows considered historical and projected pricing , remaining developmental effort , operational performance including company- specific synergies , aftermarket retention , product life cycles , material and labor pricing , and other relevant customer , contractual and market factors . where appropriate , the net cash flows are adjusted to reflect the uncertainties associated with the underlying assumptions , as well as the risk profile of the net cash flows utilized in the valuation . the adjusted future cash flows are then discounted to present value using an appropriate discount rate . projected cash flow is discounted at a required rate of return that reflects the relative risk of achieving the cash flows and the time value of money . the market approach is a valuation technique that uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets , liabilities , or a group of assets and liabilities . valuation techniques consistent with the market approach often use market multiples derived from a set of comparables . the cost approach , which estimates value by determining the current cost of replacing an asset with another of equivalent economic utility , was used , as appropriate , for property , plant and equipment . the cost to replace a given asset reflects the estimated reproduction or replacement cost , less an allowance for loss in value due to depreciation . the purchase price allocation resulted in the recognition of $ 2.8 billion of goodwill , all of which is expected to be amortizable for tax purposes . substantially all of the goodwill was assigned to our rms business . the goodwill recognized is attributable to expected revenue synergies generated by the integration of our products and technologies with those of sikorsky , costs synergies resulting from the consolidation or elimination of certain functions , and intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition , such as the assembled workforce of sikorsky . determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires the exercise of significant judgments , including the amount and timing of expected future cash flows , long-term growth rates and discount rates . the cash flows employed in the dcf analyses are based on our best estimate of future sales , earnings and cash flows after considering factors such as general market conditions , customer budgets , existing firm orders , expected future orders , contracts

adjustments required to account for the acquisition . we incurred approximately $ 38 million of non-recoverable transaction costs associated with the sikorsky acquisition in 2015 that were expensed as incurred . these costs are included in other income , net on our consolidated statements of earnings . we also incurred approximately $ 48 million in costs associated with issuing the $ 7.0 billion november 2015 notes used to repay all outstanding borrowings under the 364-day facility used to finance the acquisition . the financing costs were recorded as a reduction of debt and will be amortized

results see page 43 . income from equity method investments increased by $ 126 million in 2006 from 2005 and increased by $ 98 million in 2005 from 2004 . income from our lpg operations in equatorial guinea increased in both periods due to higher sales volumes as a result of the plant expansions completed in 2005 . the increase in 2005 also included higher ptc income as a result of higher distillate gross margins . cost of revenues increased $ 4.609 billion in 2006 from 2005 and $ 7.106 billion in 2005 from 2004 . in both periods the increases were primarily in the rm&t segment and resulted from increases in acquisition costs of crude oil , refinery charge and blend stocks and purchased refined products . the increase in both periods was also impacted by higher manufacturing expenses , primarily the result of higher contract services and labor costs in 2006 and higher purchased energy costs in 2005 . purchases related to matching buy/sell transactions decreased $ 6.968 billion in 2006 from 2005 and increased $ 3.314 billion in 2005 from 2004 , mostly in the rm&t segment . the decrease in 2006 was primarily related to the change in accounting for matching buy/sell transactions discussed above . the increase in 2005 was primarily due to increased crude oil prices . depreciation , depletion and amortization increased $ 215 million in 2006 from 2005 and $ 125 million in 2005 from 2004 . rm&t segment depreciation expense increased in both years as a result of the increase in asset value recorded for our acquisition of the 38 percent interest in mpc on june 30 , 2005 . in addition , the detroit refinery expansion completed in the fourth quarter of 2005 contributed to the rm&t depreciation expense increase in 2006 . e&p segment depreciation expense for 2006 included a $ 20 million impairment of capitalized costs related to the camden hills field in the gulf of mexico and the associated canyon express pipeline . natural gas production from the camden hills field ended in 2006 as a result of increased water production from the well . selling , general and administrative expenses increased $ 73 million in 2006 from 2005 and $ 134 million in 2005 from 2004 . the 2006 increase was primarily because personnel and staffing costs increased throughout the year primarily as a result of variable compensation arrangements and increased business activity . partially offsetting these increases were reductions in stock-based compensation expense . the increase in 2005 was primarily a result of increased stock-based compensation expense , due to the increase in our stock price during that year as well as an increase in equity-based awards , which was partially offset by a decrease in expense as a result of severance and pension plan curtailment charges and start-up costs related to egholdings in 2004 . exploration expenses increased $ 148 million in 2006 from 2005 and $ 59 million in 2005 from 2004 . exploration expense related to dry wells and other write-offs totaled $ 166 million , $ 111 million and $ 47 million in 2006 , 2005 and 2004 . exploration expense in 2006 also included $ 47 million for exiting the cortland and empire leases in nova scotia . net interest and other financing costs ( income ) reflected a net $ 37 million of income for 2006 , a favorable change of $ 183 million from the net $ 146 million expense in 2005 . net interest and other financing costs decreased $ 16 million in 2005 from 2004 . the favorable changes in 2006 included increased interest income due to higher interest rates and average cash balances , foreign currency exchange gains , adjustments to interest on tax issues and greater capitalized interest . the decrease in expense for 2005 was primarily a result of increased interest income on higher average cash balances and greater capitalized interest , partially offset by increased interest on potential tax deficiencies and higher foreign exchange losses . included in net interest and other financing costs ( income ) are foreign currency gains of $ 16 million , losses of $ 17 million and gains of $ 9 million for 2006 , 2005 and 2004 . minority interest in income of mpc decreased $ 148 million in 2005 from 2004 due to our acquisition of the 38 percent interest in mpc on june 30 , 2005 . provision for income taxes increased $ 2.308 billion in 2006 from 2005 and $ 979 million in 2005 from 2004 , primarily due to the $ 4.259 billion and $ 2.691 billion increases in income from continuing operations before income taxes . the increase in our effective income tax rate in 2006 was primarily a result of the income taxes related to our libyan operations , where the statutory income tax rate is in excess of 90 percent . the following is an analysis of the effective income tax rates for continuing operations for 2006 , 2005 and 2004 . see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. . . the statutory u.s . income tax rate of

( a ) reflects additional capital required , in the firm 2019s view , to meet its regulatory and debt rating objectives . credit risk capital credit risk capital is estimated separately for the wholesale businesses ( cib , cb and am ) and consumer business ( ccb ) . credit risk capital for the wholesale credit portfolio is defined in terms of unexpected credit losses , both from defaults and from declines in the value of the portfolio due to credit deterioration , measured over a one-year period at a confidence level consistent with an 201caa 201d credit rating standard . unexpected losses are losses in excess of those for which the allowance for credit losses is maintained . the capital methodology is based on several principal drivers of credit risk : exposure at default ( or loan-equivalent amount ) , default likelihood , credit spreads , loss severity and portfolio correlation . credit risk capital for the consumer portfolio is based on product and other relevant risk segmentation . actual segment-level default and severity experience are used to estimate unexpected losses for a one-year horizon at a confidence level consistent with an 201caa 201d credit rating standard . the decrease in credit risk capital in 2012 was driven by consumer portfolio runoff and continued model enhancements to better estimate future stress credit losses in the consumer portfolio . see credit risk management on pages 134 2013135 of this annual report for more information about these credit risk measures . market risk capital the firm calculates market risk capital guided by the principle that capital should reflect the risk of loss in the value of the portfolios and financial instruments caused by adverse movements in market variables , such as interest and foreign exchange rates , credit spreads , and securities and commodities prices , taking into account the liquidity of the financial instruments . results from daily var , weekly stress tests , issuer credit spreads and default risk calculations , as well as other factors , are used to determine appropriate capital levels . market risk capital is allocated to each business segment based on its risk assessment . the increase in market risk capital in 2012 was driven by increased risk in the synthetic credit portfolio . see market risk management on pages 163 2013169 of this annual report for more information about these market risk measures . operational risk capital operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed processes or systems , human factors or external events . the operational risk capital model is based on actual losses and potential scenario-based losses , with adjustments to the capital calculation to reflect changes in the quality of the control environment . the increase in operational risk capital in 2012 was primarily due to continued model enhancements to better capture large historical loss events , including mortgage-related litigation costs . the increases that occurred during 2012 will be fully reflected in average operational risk capital in 2013 . see operational risk management on pages 175 2013176 of this annual report for more information about operational risk . private equity risk capital capital is allocated to privately- and publicly-held securities , third-party fund investments , and commitments in the private equity portfolio , within the corporate/private equity segment , to cover the potential loss associated with a decline in equity markets and related asset devaluations . in addition to negative market fluctuations , potential losses in private equity investment portfolios can be magnified by liquidity risk. . the credit risk of yearly average 2012 is $ 46.6 ; the credit risk of yearly average 2011 is $ 48.2 ; the credit risk of yearly average 2010 is $ 49.7 ;the market risk of yearly average 2012 is 17.5 ; the market risk of yearly average 2011 is 14.5 ; the market risk of yearly average 2010 is 15.1 ;the operational risk of yearly average 2012 is 15.9 ; the operational risk of yearly average 2011 is 8.5 ; the operational risk of yearly average 2010 is 7.4 ;the private equity risk of yearly average 2012 is 6.0 ; the private equity risk of yearly average 2011 is 6.9 ; the private equity risk of yearly average 2010 is 6.2 ;the economic risk capital of yearly average 2012 is 86.0 ; the economic risk capital of yearly average 2011 is 78.1 ; the economic risk capital of yearly average 2010 is 78.4 ;the goodwill of yearly average 2012 is 48.2 ; the goodwill of yearly average 2011 is 48.6 ; the goodwill of yearly average 2010 is 48.6 ;the other ( a ) of yearly average 2012 is 50.2 ; the other ( a ) of yearly average 2011 is 46.6 ; the other ( a ) of yearly average 2010 is 34.5 ;the total common stockholders 2019equity of yearly average 2012 is $ 184.4 ; the total common stockholders 2019equity of yearly average 2011 is $ 173.3 ; the total common stockholders 2019equity of yearly average 2010 is $ 161.5 ;",

alternative for the soil remediation component of the overall site remedy . in october 2011 , the epa released a public statement indicating that the final soil remedy decision would be delayed . in the unlikely event that the epa changes its proposed soil remedy and approves instead a more expensive clean- up alternative , the remediation costs could be material , and significantly higher than amounts currently recorded . in october 2012 , the natural resource trustees for this site provided notice to international paper and other potentially responsible parties of their intent to perform a natural resource damage assessment . it is premature to predict the outcome of the assessment or to estimate a loss or range of loss , if any , which may be incurred . other remediation costs in addition to the above matters , other remediation costs typically associated with the cleanup of hazardous substances at the company 2019s current , closed or formerly-owned facilities , and recorded as liabilities in the balance sheet , totaled approximately $ 41 million as of december 31 , 2014 . other than as described above , completion of required remedial actions is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements . legal proceedings environmental kalamazoo river : the company is a potentially responsible party with respect to the allied paper , inc./ portage creek/kalamazoo river superfund site ( kalamazoo river superfund site ) in michigan . the epa asserts that the site is contaminated primarily by pcbs as a result of discharges from various paper mills located along the kalamazoo river , including a paper mill formerly owned by st . regis paper company ( st . regis ) . the company is a successor in interest to st . regis . although the company has not received any orders from the epa , in december 2014 , the epa sent the company a letter demanding payment of $ 19 million to reimburse the epa for costs associated with a time critical removal action of pcb contaminated sediments from a portion of the site . the company 2019s cercla liability has not been finally determined with respect to this or any other portion of the site and we have declined to reimburse the epa at this time . as noted below , the company is involved in allocation/ apportionment litigation with regard to the site . accordingly , it is premature to estimate a loss or range of loss with respect to this site . the company was named as a defendant by georgia- pacific consumer products lp , fort james corporation and georgia pacific llc in a contribution and cost recovery action for alleged pollution at the site . the suit . the lease obligations of 2015 is $ 142 ; the lease obligations of 2016 is $ 106 ; the lease obligations of 2017 is

favorable reflecting strong mill performance . planned main- tenance downtime costs were slightly higher in 2012 . no market-related downtime was taken in either 2012 or 2011 . entering the first quarter of 2013 , sales volumes are expected to increase compared with the fourth quar- ter of 2012 reflecting seasonally stronger demand . average sales price realizations are expected to be

operating costs and planned maintenance downtime costs were lower than in 2011 . looking ahead to 2013 , sales volumes in the first quarter are expected to be lower than in the fourth quarter of 2012

2007 annual report expected loss modeling in 2006 , the firm restructured four multi-seller conduits that it administers . the restructurings included enhancing the firm 2019s expected loss model . in determining the primary beneficiary of the conduits it administers , the firm uses a monte carlo 2013based model to estimate the expected losses of each of the conduits and considers the rela- tive rights and obligations of each of the variable interest holders . the variability to be considered in the modeling of expected losses is based on the design of the entity . the firm 2019s traditional multi-seller conduits are designed to pass credit risk , not liquidity risk , to its vari- able interest holders , as the assets are intended to be held in the conduit for the longer term . under fin 46r , the firm is required to run the monte carlo-based expected loss model each time a reconsideration event occurs . in applying this guidance to the conduits , the following events are considered to be reconsideration events as they could affect the determination of the primary beneficiary of the conduits : 2022 new deals , including the issuance of new or additional variable interests ( credit support , liquidity facilities , etc ) ; 2022 changes in usage , including the change in the level of outstand- ing variable interests ( credit support , liquidity facilities , etc ) ; 2022 modifications of asset purchase agreements ; and 2022 sales of interests held by the primary beneficiary . from an operational perspective , the firm does not run its monte carlo-based expected loss model every time there is a reconsidera- tion event due to the frequency of their occurrence . instead , the firm runs its expected loss model each quarter and includes a growth assumption for each conduit to ensure that a sufficient amount of elns exists for each conduit at any point during the quarter . as part of its normal quarterly model review , the firm reassesses the underlying assumptions and inputs of the expected loss model . during the second half of 2007 , certain assumptions used in the model were adjusted to reflect the then current market conditions . specifically , risk ratings and loss given default assumptions relating to residential subprime mortgage exposures were modified . for other nonmortgage-related asset classes , the firm determined that the assumptions in the model required little adjustment . as a result of the updates to the model , during the fourth quarter of 2007 the terms of the elns were renegotiated to increase the level of commit- ment and funded amounts to be provided by the eln holders . the total amount of expected loss notes outstanding at december 31 , 2007 and 2006 , were $ 130 million and $ 54 million , respectively . management concluded that the model assumptions used were reflective of market participant 2019s assumptions and appropriately considered the probability of a recurrence of recent market events . qualitative considerations the multi-seller conduits are primarily designed to provide an efficient means for clients to access the commercial paper market . the firm believes the conduits effectively disperse risk among all parties and that the preponderance of economic risk in the firm 2019s multi-seller conduits is not held by jpmorgan chase . the percentage of assets in the multi-seller conduits that the firm views as client-related represent 99% ( 99 % ) and 98% ( 98 % ) of the total conduits 2019 holdings at december 31 , 2007 and 2006 , respectively . consolidated sensitivity analysis on capital it is possible that the firm could be required to consolidate a vie if it were determined that the firm became the primary beneficiary of the vie under the provisions of fin 46r . the factors involved in making the determination of whether or not a vie should be consolidated are dis- cussed above and in note 1 on page 108 of this annual report . the table below shows the impact on the firm 2019s reported assets , liabilities , net income , tier 1 capital ratio and tier 1 leverage ratio if the firm were required to consolidate all of the multi-seller conduits that it administers . as of or for the year ending december 31 , 2007 . the firm could fund purchases of assets from vies should it become necessary . investor intermediation as a financial intermediary , the firm creates certain types of vies and also structures transactions , typically derivative structures , with these vies to meet investor needs . the firm may also provide liquidity and other support . the risks inherent in the derivative instruments or liq- uidity commitments are managed similarly to other credit , market or liquidity risks to which the firm is exposed . the principal types of vies for which the firm is engaged in these structuring activities are municipal bond vehicles , credit-linked note vehicles and collateralized debt obligation vehicles . municipal bond vehicles the firm has created a series of secondary market trusts that provide short-term investors with qualifying tax-exempt investments , and that allow investors in tax-exempt securities to finance their investments at short-term tax-exempt rates . in a typical transaction , the vehicle pur- chases fixed-rate longer-term highly rated municipal bonds and funds the purchase by issuing two types of securities : ( 1 ) putable floating- rate certificates and ( 2 ) inverse floating-rate residual interests ( 201cresid- ual interests 201d ) . the maturity of each of the putable floating-rate certifi- cates and the residual interests is equal to the life of the vehicle , while the maturity of the underlying municipal bonds is longer . holders of the putable floating-rate certificates may 201cput 201d , or tender , the certifi- cates if the remarketing agent cannot successfully remarket the float- ing-rate certificates to another investor . a liquidity facility conditionally obligates the liquidity provider to fund the purchase of the tendered floating-rate certificates . upon termination of the vehicle , if the pro- ceeds from the sale of the underlying municipal bonds are not suffi- cient to repay the liquidity facility , the liquidity provider has recourse either to excess collateralization in the vehicle or the residual interest holders for reimbursement . the third-party holders of the residual interests in these vehicles could experience losses if the face amount of the putable floating-rate cer- tificates exceeds the market value of the municipal bonds upon termi- nation of the vehicle . certain vehicles require a smaller initial invest- ment by the residual interest holders and thus do not result in excess collateralization . for these vehicles

gas reserves committee , and is a registered professional engineer in the state of texas . changes in proved undeveloped reserves as of december 31 , 2014 , 728 mmboe of proved undeveloped reserves were reported , an increase of 101 mmboe from december 31 , 2013 . the following table shows changes in total proved undeveloped reserves for 2014 : ( mmboe ) . significant additions to proved undeveloped reserves during 2014 included 121 mmboe in the eagle ford and 61 mmboe in the bakken shale plays due to development drilling . transfers from proved undeveloped to proved developed

relating to the development of proved undeveloped reserves , were $ 3149 million , $ 2536 million and $ 1995 million . a total of 102 mmboe was booked as extensions , discoveries or other additions due to the application of reliable technology . technologies included statistical analysis of production performance , decline curve analysis , pressure and rate transient analysis , reservoir simulation and volumetric analysis . the statistical nature of production performance coupled with highly certain reservoir continuity or quality within the reliable technology areas and sufficient proved undeveloped locations establish the reasonable certainty criteria required for booking proved reserves . projects can remain in proved undeveloped reserves for extended periods in certain situations such as large development projects which take more than five years to complete , or the timing of when additional gas compression is needed . of the 728 mmboe of proved undeveloped reserves at december 31 , 2014 , 19 percent of the volume is associated with projects that have been included in proved reserves for more than five years . the majority of this volume is related to a compression project in e.g . that was sanctioned by our board of directors in 2004 . the timing of the installation of compression is being driven by the reservoir performance with this project intended to maintain maximum production levels . performance of this field since the board sanctioned the project has far exceeded expectations . estimates of initial dry gas in place increased by roughly 10 percent between 2004 and 2010 . during 2012 , the compression project received the approval of the e.g . government , allowing design and planning work to progress towards implementation , with completion expected by mid-2016 . the other component of alba proved undeveloped reserves is an infill well approved in 2013 and to be drilled in the second quarter of 2015 . proved undeveloped reserves for the north gialo development , located in the libyan sahara desert , were booked for the first time in 2010 . this development , which is anticipated to take more than five years to develop , is executed by the operator and encompasses a multi-year drilling program including the design , fabrication and installation of extensive liquid handling and gas recycling facilities . anecdotal evidence from similar development projects in the region lead to an expected project execution time frame of more than five years from the time the reserves were initially booked . interruptions associated with the civil unrest in 2011 and third-party labor strikes and civil unrest in 2013-2014 have also extended the project duration . as of december 31 , 2014 , future development costs estimated to be required for the development of proved undeveloped crude oil and condensate , ngls , natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves related to continuing operations for

position requires annual ground lease payments totaling $ 6000 and sub-leasehold position pay- ments totaling $ 1100 ( excluding an operating sub-lease position purchased january 1999 ) . the ground lease and sub-leasehold positions expire 2008 . the company may extend the positions through 2029 at market rents . the property located at 1140 avenue of the americas operates under a net ground lease ( $ 348 annually ) with a term expiration date of 2016 and with an option to renew for an additional 50 years . the property located at 711 third avenue operates under an operating sub-lease

the ground rent is reset after year ten based on the estimated fair market value of the property . in april 1988 , the sl green predecessor entered into a lease agreement for property at 673 first avenue in new york city , which has been capitalized for financial statement purposes . land was estimated to be approximately 70% ( 70 % ) of the fair market value of the property . the portion of

however , we do not expect these changes will have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial position . the u.s . federal statute of limitations remains open for the year 2003 and onward . the u.s . federal returns for years 2003 and 2004 are currently under examination by the irs . on july 15 , 2008 , the irs issued its examination report . we filed a formal protest on august 15 , 2008 and requested a conference with the appeals office regarding disputed issues . although the appeals process could take several years , we do not anticipate resolution of the audit will result in any significant impact on our results of operations , financial position or cash flows . in addition , for the 1999 tax year of centerpulse , which we acquired in october 2003 , one issue remains in dispute . state income tax returns are generally subject to examination for a period of 3 to 5 years after filing of the respective return . the state impact of any federal changes remains subject to examination by various states for a period of up to one year after formal notification to the states . we have various state income tax returns in the process of examination , administrative appeals or litigation . it is z i m m e r h o l d i n g s , i n c . 2 0 0 8 f o r m 1 0 - k a n n u a l r e p o r t notes to consolidated financial statements ( continued ) %%transmsg*** transmitting job : c48761 pcn : 057000000 ***%%pcmsg|57 |00010|yes|no|02/24/2009 06:10|0|0|page is valid , no graphics -- color : d| . the balance at january 1 of 2008 is $ 135.2 ;

( a ) includes collateral related to derivative instruments where an appropriate legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained . derivative receivables reported on the consolidated balance sheets were $ 64.1 billion and $ 59.7 billion at december 31 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively . these amounts represent the fair value of the derivative contracts after giving effect to legally enforceable master netting agreements and cash collateral held by the firm . however , in management 2019s view , the appropriate measure of current credit risk should also take into consideration additional liquid securities ( primarily u.s . government and agency securities and other group of seven nations ( 201cg7 201d ) government bonds ) and other cash collateral held by the firm aggregating $ 22.7 billion and $ 16.6 billion at december 31 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively , that may be used as security when the fair value of the client 2019s exposure is in the firm 2019s favor . the change in derivative receivables was predominantly related to client-driven market-making activities in cib . the increase in derivative receivables reflected the impact of market movements , which increased foreign exchange receivables , partially offset by reduced commodity derivative receivables . in addition to the collateral described in the preceding paragraph , the firm also holds additional collateral ( primarily cash , g7 government securities , other liquid government-agency and guaranteed securities , and corporate debt and equity securities ) delivered by clients at the initiation of transactions , as well as collateral related to contracts that have a non-daily call frequency and collateral that the firm has agreed to return but has not yet settled as of the reporting date . although this collateral does not reduce the balances and is not included in the table above , it is available as security against potential exposure that could arise should the fair value of the client 2019s derivative transactions move in the firm 2019s favor . the derivative receivables fair value , net of all collateral , also does not include other credit enhancements , such as letters of credit . for additional information on the firm 2019s use of collateral agreements , see note 6 . while useful as a current view of credit exposure , the net fair value of the derivative receivables does not capture the potential future variability of that credit exposure . to capture the potential future variability of credit exposure , the firm calculates , on a client-by-client basis , three measures of potential derivatives-related credit loss : peak , derivative risk equivalent ( 201cdre 201d ) , and average exposure ( 201cavg 201d ) . these measures all incorporate netting and collateral benefits , where applicable . peak represents a conservative measure of potential exposure to a counterparty calculated in a manner that is broadly equivalent to a 97.5% ( 97.5 % ) confidence level over the life of the transaction . peak is the primary measure used by the firm for setting of credit limits for derivative transactions , senior management reporting and derivatives exposure management . dre exposure is a measure that expresses the risk of derivative exposure on a basis intended to be equivalent to the risk of loan exposures . dre is a less extreme measure of potential credit loss than peak and is used for aggregating derivative credit risk exposures with loans and other credit risk . finally , avg is a measure of the expected fair value of the firm 2019s derivative receivables at future time periods , including the benefit of collateral . avg exposure over the total life of the derivative contract is used as the primary metric for pricing purposes and is used to calculate credit capital and the cva , as further described below . the three year avg exposure was $ 31.1 billion and $ 32.4 billion at december 31 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively , compared with derivative receivables , net of all collateral , of $ 41.4 billion and $ 43.1 billion at december 31 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively . the fair value of the firm 2019s derivative receivables incorporates an adjustment , the cva , to reflect the credit quality of counterparties . the cva is based on the firm 2019s avg to a counterparty and the counterparty 2019s credit spread in the credit derivatives market . the primary components of changes in cva are credit spreads , new deal activity or unwinds , and changes in the underlying market environment . the firm believes that active risk management is essential to controlling the dynamic credit . the interest rate of 2016 is $ 28302 ;

( a ) includes collateral related to derivative instruments where an appropriate legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained . derivative receivables reported on the consolidated balance sheets were $ 56.5 billion and $ 64.1 billion at december 31 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively . derivative receivables decreased predominantly as a result of client- driven market-making activities in cib markets , which reduced foreign exchange and interest rate derivative receivables , and increased equity derivative receivables , driven by market movements . derivative receivables amounts represent the fair value of the derivative contracts after giving effect to legally enforceable master netting agreements and cash collateral held by the firm . however , in management 2019s view , the appropriate measure of current credit risk should also take into consideration additional liquid securities ( primarily u.s . government and agency securities and other group of seven nations ( 201cg7 201d ) government bonds ) and other cash collateral held by the firm aggregating $ 16.1 billion and $ 22.7 billion at december 31 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively , that may be used as security when the fair value of the client 2019s exposure is in the firm 2019s favor . in addition to the collateral described in the preceding paragraph , the firm also holds additional collateral ( primarily cash , g7 government securities , other liquid government-agency and guaranteed securities , and corporate debt and equity securities ) delivered by clients at the initiation of transactions , as well as collateral related to contracts that have a non-daily call frequency and collateral that the firm has agreed to return but has not yet settled as of the reporting date . although this collateral does not reduce the balances and is not included in the table above , it is available as security against potential exposure that could arise should the fair value of the client 2019s derivative transactions move in the firm 2019s favor . the derivative receivables fair value , net of all collateral , also does not include other credit enhancements , such as letters of credit . for additional information on the firm 2019s use of collateral agreements , see note 5 . while useful as a current view of credit exposure , the net fair value of the derivative receivables does not capture the potential future variability of that credit exposure . to capture the potential future variability of credit exposure , the firm calculates , on a client-by-client basis , three measures of potential derivatives-related credit loss : peak , derivative risk equivalent ( 201cdre 201d ) , and average exposure ( 201cavg 201d ) . these measures all incorporate netting and collateral benefits , where applicable . peak represents a conservative measure of potential exposure to a counterparty calculated in a manner that is broadly equivalent to a 97.5% ( 97.5 % ) confidence level over the life of the transaction . peak is the primary measure used by the firm for setting of credit limits for derivative transactions , senior management reporting and derivatives exposure management . dre exposure is a measure that expresses the risk of derivative exposure on a basis intended to be equivalent to the risk of loan exposures . dre is a less extreme measure of potential credit loss than peak and is used for aggregating derivative credit risk exposures with loans and other credit risk . finally , avg is a measure of the expected fair value of the firm 2019s derivative receivables at future time periods , including the benefit of collateral . avg exposure over the total life of the derivative contract is used as the primary metric for pricing purposes and is used to calculate credit risk capital and the cva , as further described below . the three year avg exposure was $ 29.0 billion and $ 31.1 billion at december 31 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively , compared with derivative receivables , net of all collateral , of $ 40.4 billion and $ 41.4 billion at december 31 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively . the fair value of the firm 2019s derivative receivables incorporates cva to reflect the credit quality of counterparties . cva is based on the firm 2019s avg to a counterparty and the counterparty 2019s credit spread in the credit derivatives market . the firm believes that active risk management is essential to controlling the dynamic credit risk in the derivatives portfolio . in addition , the firm 2019s risk management process takes into consideration the potential . the interest rate of 2017 is $ 24673 ;

states treasury zero coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected option life assumed at the date of grant . the expected term was calculated based on historical experience and represents the time period options actually remain outstanding . we estimate forfeitures based on historical pre-vesting forfeiture rates and revise those estimates as appropriate to reflect actual experience .

nonperforming or accruing past due categories and for which we are uncertain about the borrower 2019s ability to comply with existing repayment terms . these loans totaled $ .2 billion at both december 31 , 2014 and december 31 , 2013 . home equity loan portfolio our home equity loan portfolio totaled $ 34.7 billion as of december 31 , 2014 , or 17% ( 17 % ) of the total loan portfolio . of that total , $ 20.4 billion , or 59% ( 59 % ) , was outstanding under primarily variable-rate home equity lines of credit and $ 14.3 billion , or 41% ( 41 % ) , consisted of closed-end home equity installment loans . approximately 3% ( 3 % ) of the home equity portfolio was on nonperforming status as of december 31 , 2014 . as of december 31 , 2014 , we are in an originated first lien position for approximately 51% ( 51 % ) of the total portfolio and , where originated as a second lien , we currently hold or service the first lien position for approximately an additional 2% ( 2 % ) of the portfolio . the remaining 47% ( 47 % ) of the portfolio was secured by second liens where we do not hold the first lien position . the credit performance of the majority of the home equity portfolio where we are in , hold or service the first lien position , is superior to the portion of the portfolio where we hold the second lien position but do not hold the first lien . lien position information is generally based upon original ltv at the time of origination . however , after origination pnc is not typically notified when a senior lien position that is not held by pnc is satisfied . therefore , information about the current lien status of junior lien loans is less readily available in cases where pnc does not also hold the senior lien . additionally , pnc is not typically notified when a junior lien position is added after origination of a pnc first lien . this updated information for both junior and senior liens must be obtained from external sources , and therefore , pnc has contracted with an industry-leading third-party service provider to obtain updated loan , lien and collateral data that is aggregated from public and private sources . we track borrower performance monthly , including obtaining original ltvs , updated fico scores at least quarterly , updated ltvs semi-annually , and other credit metrics at least quarterly , including the historical performance of any mortgage loans regardless of lien position that we do or do not hold . this information is used for internal reporting and risk management . for internal reporting and risk management we also segment the population into pools based on product type ( e.g. , home equity loans , brokered home equity loans , home equity lines of credit , brokered home equity lines of credit ) . as part of our overall risk analysis and monitoring , we segment the home equity portfolio based upon the delinquency , modification status and bankruptcy status of these loans , as well as the delinquency , modification status and bankruptcy status of any mortgage loan with the same borrower ( regardless of whether it is a first lien senior to our second lien ) . in establishing our alll for non-impaired loans , we primarily utilize a delinquency roll-rate methodology for pools of loans . in accordance with accounting principles , under this methodology , we establish our allowance based upon incurred losses , not lifetime expected losses . the roll-rate methodology estimates transition/roll of loan balances from one delinquency state ( e.g. , 30-59 days past due ) to another delinquency state ( e.g. , 60-89 days past due ) and ultimately to charge-off . the roll through to charge-off is based on pnc 2019s actual loss experience for each type of pool . each of our home equity pools contains both first and second liens . our experience has been that the ratio of first to second lien loans has been consistent over time and the charge-off amounts for the pools , used to establish our allowance , include losses on both first and second liens loans . generally , our variable-rate home equity lines of credit have either a seven or ten year draw period , followed by a 20-year amortization term . during the draw period , we have home equity lines of credit where borrowers pay either interest or principal and interest . we view home equity lines of credit where borrowers are paying principal and interest under the draw period as less risky than those where the borrowers are paying interest only , as these borrowers have a demonstrated ability to make some level of principal and interest payments . the risk associated with the borrower 2019s ability to satisfy the loan terms upon the draw period ending is considered in establishing our alll . based upon outstanding balances at december 31 , 2014 , the following table presents the periods when home equity lines of credit draw periods are scheduled to end . table 36 : home equity lines of credit 2013
