The doppler effect changes the light's intensity, making it brighter when the source moves away and dimmer when it moves towards the detector.\nB. The doppler effect changes the light's wavelength, causing redshift when the source moves away and blueshift when it moves towards the detector.\nC. The doppler effect changes the light's polarization, causing it to become more linearly polarized when the source moves away and more circularly polarized when it moves towards the detector.\nD. The doppler effect changes the light's speed, causing it to travel faster when the source moves away and slower when it moves towards the detector.\n\nAnswer:",
