Increases were primarily due to 2022 special item costs for\nsignificant litigation from additional commitments to address PFAS-related matters at 3M's Zwijndrecht, Belgium site (discussed in Note 16), higher raw materials and logistics\ncosts, manufacturing productivity headwinds which were further magnified by the shutdown of certain operations in Belgium and progress on restarting previously-idled\noperations, and investments in growth, productivity and sustainability. On a percent of sales basis, these increases were partially offset by increases in selling prices.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses:\nSG&A, measured as a percent of sales, increased in 2022 when compared to the same period last year. SG&A was impacted by increased special item costs for significant\nlitigation primarily related to steps toward resolving Combat Arms Earplugs litigation (discussed in Note 16) resulting in a 2022 second quarter pre-tax charge of approximately\n$1.2 billion, certain impairment costs related to exiting PFAS manufacturing (see Note 15), costs related to exiting Russia (see Note 15), divestiture-related restructuring\ncharges (see Note 5), and continued investment in key growth initiatives. These increases were partially offset by restructuring benefits and ongoing general 3M cost\nmanagement.\nResearch, Development and Related Expenses:\nR&D, measured as a percent of sales, decreased in 2022 when compared to the same period last year. 3M continues to invest in a range of R&D activities from application\ndevelopment, product and manufacturing support, product development and technology development aimed at disruptive innovations.\nGain on Business Divestitures:\nIn the third quarter of 2022, 3M recorded a pre-tax gain of $2.7 billion ($2.7 billion after tax) related to the split-off and combination of its Food Safety business with Neogen\nCorporation. Refer to Note 3 for further details.\nGoodwill Impairment Expense:\nAs a result of 3M's commitment to exit per- and polyfluoroalkyl substance (PFAS) manufacturing, 3M recorded a goodwill impairment charge related to the Advanced\nMaterials reporting unit (within the Transportation and Electronics business).

This is\ndriven by 15% growth in segment net sales in Optical Communications of $674 million and 34% growth in Hemlock and Emerging Growth Businesses of $419 million,\nwhich helped offset a $394 million decrease in Display Technologies.

When compared to 2021, the $590\nmillion decrease was primarily driven by a $238 million increase in severance, accelerated depreciation, asset write-offs and other related charges, a $50 million increase\nin litigation, regulatory and other legal matters and a $120 million adverse impact from foreign currency translation.\n \nDiluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased by $0.26 per diluted share, or 20%, when compared to the year ended December 31, 2021,\nprimarily driven by the immediate repurchase and retirement of 35 million common shares which resulted in an $803 million one-time reduction to net income available\nto common shareholders in 2021, partially offset by the decrease in net income attributable to Corning Incorporated as described above.

The relator alleges that the Company submitted, or caused\nto be submitted, to Part D of the Medicare program Prescription Drug Event data and/or Direct and Indirect Remuneration reports that misrepresented true\nprices paid by the Companys PBM to pharmacies for drugs dispensed to Part D beneficiaries with prescription benefits administered by the Companys PBM.\nThe Company is defending itself against these claims.\n171\n\n\nControlled Substances Litigation, Audits and Subpoenas\nIn December 2017, the U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation consolidated numerous cases filed against various defendants by plaintiffs such as\ncounties, cities, hospitals, Indian tribes and third-party payors, alleging claims beginning as far back as the early 2000s generally concerning the impacts of\nwidespread prescription opioid abuse. The consolidated multidistrict litigation captioned In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804) is\npending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. This multidistrict litigation presumptively includes hundreds of relevant federal court cases\nthat name the Company as a defendant. A significant number of similar cases that name the Company as a defendant in some capacity are pending in state\ncourts.\nIn addition, the Company has been named as a defendant in similar cases brought by certain state Attorneys General. The Company is defending itself against\nall such claims. Additionally, the Company has received subpoenas, CIDs, and/or other requests for information regarding opioids from state Attorneys General\nand insurance and other regulators of several U.S. jurisdictions. The Company has been cooperating with the government with respect to these subpoenas,\nCIDs, and other requests for information.\nIn November 2021, the Company was among the chain pharmacies found liable by a jury in a trial in federal court in Ohio; in August 2022, the court issued a\njudgment jointly against the three defendants in the amount of $651 million to be paid over 15 years, and also ordered certain injunctive relief. The Company is\nappealing the judgment and has not accrued a liability for this matter. In March 2022, CVS Health Corporation and CVS Pharmacy, Inc. entered into a\nsettlement agreement with the State of Florida to resolve claims related to opioid medications dating back more than a decade. Under the terms of the\nsettlement agreement, CVS Health Corporation settled all opioid claims against it and its subsidiaries by the State of Florida for $484 million, which is to be\npaid over a period of 18 years. During the three months ended March 31, 2022, the Company recorded a $484 million liability associated with this legal\nsettlement. In August 2022, CVS Pharmacy, Inc. entered into an agreement with the State of New Mexico to settle all opioid claims against it and its parents\nand subsidiaries by the State of New Mexico and participating subdivisions. In September 2022, CVS Pharmacy, Inc. entered into an agreement with the State\nof West Virginia to settle all opioid claims against it and its parents and subsidiaries by the State of West Virginia and participating subdivisions. Also in\nSeptember 2022, CVS Pharmacy, Inc. entered into an agreement with the Cherokee Nation to settle all opioid claims against it and its parents and subsidiaries\nby the Cherokee Nation.\nIn December 2022, the Company agreed to a formal settlement agreement, the financial amounts of which were agreed to in principle in October 2022, with a\nleadership group of a number of state Attorneys General and the Plaintiffs Executive Committee (PEC). The agreement would resolve substantially all\nopioid claims against Company entities by states and political subdivisions, but not private plaintiffs. The maximum amount payable by the Company under the\nsettlement would be approximately $4.3 billion in opioid remediation and $625 million in attorneys fees and costs and additional remediation. The amounts\nwould be payable over 10 years, beginning in 2023. The agreement also contains injunctive terms relating to the dispensing of opioid medications. The\nsettlement agreement is available at nationalopioidsettlement.com.\nUnder the settlement agreement, before the Company determines whether to enter into any final settlement, it will assess the number and identities of the\ngovernmental entities that will participate in any such settlement. The settlement agreement contemplates that if certain governmental entities do not agree to\nthe settlement, but the Company nonetheless concludes that there is sufficient participation to warrant going forward with the settlement, there would be a\ncorresponding reduction in the amount due from the Company to account for the governmental entities that did not agree. Those non-participating\ngovernmental entities would be entitled to pursue their claims against the Company and other defendants. Private plaintiff litigation will also continue.\nThe Company has been informed that 45 states, the District of Columbia, and all eligible United States territories have elected to join the settlement. Three\nstates were the subject of earlier settlements. The Company has elected to proceed with the settlement process based on that level of participation. The\nsettlement process will progress to the period during which subdivisions may elect to join.\nIn December 2022, the Company also agreed to a formal settlement agreement with a leadership group representing tribes throughout the United States. The\nagreement would resolve substantially all opioid claims against Company entities by such tribes. The maximum amount payable by the Company under the\nsettlement would be $113 million in opioid remediation and $18 million in attorneys fees and costs. The amounts would be payable over 10 years, beginning\nin 2023. The agreement is contingent upon sufficient participation by tribes.\n172\n [END OF FILING]",
