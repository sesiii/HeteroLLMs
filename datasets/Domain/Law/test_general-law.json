Located below the ranch is an estate that is owned by a millionaire. A stream is a non-navigable watercourse that originates at the top of the mountain and runs all the way down into a valley. Both the ranch and the estate are within the watershed of the stream. When the millionaire purchased the estate in 1956, he started taking water from the stream and used it to irrigate the southern half of his property, which he has used as a farm. Prior to 1956, the southern half of the estate had been cleared and placed in cultivation, while the northern half remained wooded and virtually unused. The millionaire continued this established pattern of use and has never stopped using the water in this way. In 1986, the rancher built a home on the ranch and started talcing water from the stream for domestic purposes. During that year there was heavy rainfall, and this caused the stream to run down the mountain at a high water level. However, in 1987, a drought caused the stream to flow at a very low level. Consequently, there was only enough water to irrigate the millionaire's farmland or, in the alternative, to supply all of the rancher's domestic water needs and one-quarter of the millionaire's irrigation requirements. The mountain is located in a jurisdiction where the period of prescription is 15 years. The rancher is continuing to take water for his personal needs and there is insufficient water to irrigate the estate. The millionaire then brings an appropriate action in 1996 to declare that his water rights to the stream are superior to those of the rancher. In addition, the millionaire moves to have the full flow of the stream passed to him, notwithstanding the effect it might have on the rancher. If this state follows the common law of riparian rights, but does not follow the doctrine of prior appropriation, judgment should be for whom?\n\nThe following choices are provided:\n(A) The rancher, because the drought conditions give him priority access to the water.\n(B) The millionaire, as he was using the water first for his estate's needs.\n(C) The millionaire, because he has a right to the water for irrigation purposes.\n(D) Neither, because both have equal rights to the water as it runs through both of their properties.\n(E) The millionaire, because he put the water to a beneficial use prior to the rancher's use and has continuously used the water.\n(F) The rancher, because the millionaire's use of the water is excessive and unnecessary.\n(G) The millionaire, because he obtained an easement by prescription to remove as much water as he may need.\n(H) The rancher, because domestic use is superior to and is protected against an agricultural use.\n(I) The rancher, because as an upstream landowner, he would have superior rights to the water than a downstream owner.\n(J) The millionaire, because he has been using the water for a longer period of time.\n\nPlease finish your answer with \"the answer is (X)\" where X is the correct letter choice.",

In accordance with the new law, all ink cartridges within the state must be sold in paper cartons that are recyclable. Before the passage of the law, approximately 28% of all ink cartridges used in the state was packaged in plastic bags. Of that total, 75% of the ink cartridges was packaged outside the state, while 25% was packaged by companies in-state. The legislature passed the bill at the strong urging of the paper industry.
