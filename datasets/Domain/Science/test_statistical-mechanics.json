    "prompt": "Consider a one-dimensional spin chain, in which any pair of spins are separated by m lattice constants. The correlation function between these two spins varies exponentially with the m. The corresponding length scale depends upon elements of the transfer matrix between two nearest neighbors of the spin chain.
