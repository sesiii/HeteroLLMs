A retrospective review was performed in 85 patients with Marfan syndrome who underwent aortic root replacement for annuloaortic ectasia with or without aortic dissection (mean age 37 years, range 19-61 years). These 85 patients were divided into four groups according to the postoperative condition of the residual aorta. In group I (n = 47), the patients underwent aortic root replacement for annuloaortic ectasia with or without localized dissection in the ascending aorta. In these patients the residual aorta, including the aortic arch, was therefore intact. In group II (n = 10), the aortic arch was intact, although the descending thoracic aorta was dissected because of the preoperative type B dissection. In groups III and IV, the patients had type A dissection involving the transverse arch associated with annuloaortic ectasia. In group III (n = 13), residual dissection existed in the descending thoracic aorta after concomitant total arch replacement. In group IV (n = 15), the aortic arch and the descending thoracic aorta were dissected. There were 5 early deaths (3 in group I, 1 in group II, and 1 in group III). Subsequent operations were required in 10, 5, 6, and 7 cases in groups I, II, III, and IV, respectively. Regarding the aortic arch, only 2 of 53 survivors of the initial hospitalization with an intact aortic arch (groups I and II) underwent subsequent total arch replacement for the onset of dissection in the aortic arch, and 4 of 14 survivors of the initial hospitalization with a residual dissecting arch (group III) needed subsequent total arch replacement. Actuarial freedom from arch repair among patients with an intact aortic arch (91% at 15 years) was significantly higher than that among patients with a residual dissecting arch (49% at 15 years, P =.0078).\nQuestion: Should the transverse aortic arch be replaced simultaneously with aortic root replacement for annuloaortic ectasia in Marfan syndrome?",
    "expected_answer": "The incidence of new dissection in the residual intact arch after aortic root replacement was extremely low. Therefore prophylactic replacement of the intact arch does not appear to be necessary at aortic root replacement for annuloaortic ectasia in Marfan syndrome.",

The indications for preputial surgery were recurrent balanoposthitis, ballooning during micturition and severe phimotic stenosis. The results after surgery were assessed using a questionnaire about the child's/parent's satisfaction, and an outpatient follow-up examination for functional and cosmetic preputial appearance. Of 128 parents/children responding, 108 (84%) were satisfied with the function and 102 (80%) reported a good cosmetic outcome.

Currently, the treatment of rib fractures is symptomatic. Since it has been reported that pulsed ultrasounds accelerates repair of limb fractures, we hypothesized that the application of pulsed ultrasounds will modify the course of healing in an animal model of rib fracture. We studied 136 male Sprague-Dawley rats. Animals were randomly assigned to different groups of doses (none, 50, 100, and 250 mW/cm(2) of intensity for 3 minutes per day) and durations (2, 10, 20, and 28 days) of treatment with pulsed ultrasounds. In every subgroup, we analyzed radiologic and histologic changes in the bone callus. In addition, we examined changes in gene expression of relevant genes involved in wound repair in both control and treated animals. Histologic and radiologic consolidation was significantly increased by pulsed ultrasound treatment when applied for more than 10 days. The application of 50 mW/cm(2) was the most effective dose. Only the 100 and 250 mW/cm(2) doses were able to significantly increase messenger RNA expression of insulin-like growth factor 1, suppressor of cytokine signaling-2 and -3, and vascular endothelial growth factor and decrease monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and collagen type II-alpha 1.\nQuestion: Pulsed ultrasounds accelerate healing of rib fractures in an experimental animal model: an effective new thoracic therapy?",

We sought to evaluate the influence of surgical timing on patient outcomes and hypothesized that delayed repair does not improve survival in CDH. Prospectively collected data from 1,385 CDH Registry infants without preoperative extracorporeal membrane oxygen therapy (ECMO) were evaluated. Patients were stratified by timing of repair: Day of life (DOL) 0-3 (group 1), 4-7 (group 2), or>8 (group 3), and the effect of surgical timing on mortality was determined by logistic regression and risk-adjusted for severity of illness. The unadjusted odds ratio (OR) for mortality increased significantly with delayed repair (group 2, 1.73 [95% CI, 1.00-2.98; group 3, 3.42 [95% CI, 1.97-5.96]). However, when adjusted for severity of illness, delay in repair did not predict increased mortality (group 2, 1.2 [95% CI, 0.7-2.2]; group 3, 1.4 [95% CI, 0.8-2.6]), nor did it portend an increased need for postoperative ECMO (group 2, 1.1 [95% CI, 0.5-2.4]; group 3, 0.5 [95% CI, 0.2-1.4]).\nQuestion: A risk-stratified analysis of delayed congenital diaphragmatic hernia repair: does timing of operation matter?",

    "prompt": "Answer the question based on the following context: Long-term lamivudine therapy is required for patients with chronic hepatitis B, because hepatitis reappears frequently after it has withdrawn. However, hepatitis B virus (HBV) mutants resistant to lamivudine emerge frequently accompanied by breakthrough hepatitis. Effects of entecavir were evaluated in 19 patients who had developed breakthrough hepatitis during lamivudine therapy for longer than 5 years. This study is a subgroup analysis of a previously reported study. Entecavir, in either 0.5 or 1.0 mg/day doses, was given to 10 and nine patients for 52 weeks, respectively, and then all received 1.0 mg/day entecavir for an additional 68-92 weeks. There were no differences in biochemical and virological responses in the two groups of patients with respect to the two different initial doses of entecavir. Serum levels of alanine aminotransferase were normalized in 17 (90%) patients, and hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) disappeared from the serum in two (14%) of the 14 patients who were HBeAg-positive before. Furthermore, a decrease in histological activity index score greater than 2 points was achieved in nine of the 11 (82%) patients in whom annual liver biopsies were performed during 3 years while they received entecavir. HBV mutants resistant to entecavir emerged in five of the 19 (26%) patients, and hepatitis flare occurred in two of them (40%).\nQuestion: Efficacy of entecavir treatment for lamivudine-resistant hepatitis B over 3 years: histological improvement or entecavir resistance?",
    "expected_answer": "Entecavir in the long term would be useful for histological improvement of breakthrough hepatitis induced by lamivudine-resistant HBV mutants in patients with chronic hepatitis B. However, the relatively high rate of entecavir resistance is a concern, and other strategies need to be considered when available.",

    "prompt": "Answer the question based on the following context: Seeds of annual halophytes such as Suaeda maritima experience fluctuating salinity, hydration, hypoxia and temperature during dormancy. Germination then occurs in one flush of 2-3 weeks after about 5 months of winter dormancy during which time the seeds can remain in saline, often waterlogged soil. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of simulated natural conditions during dormancy on germination and to compare this with germination following the usual conditions of storing seeds dry. The effects of hydration, salinity, hypoxia and temperature regimes imposed during dormancy on germination were investigated. Also looked at were the effects of seed size on germination and the interaction between salinity during dormancy and salinity at the time of germination. Various pre-treatments were imposed on samples of seeds that had been stored dry or wet for different periods of time during the 5 months of natural dormancy. Subsequent germination tests were carried out in conditions that simulated those found in the spring when germination occurs naturally. Various salinities were imposed at germination for a test of interaction between storage salinity and salinity at germination. A temperature of about 15 degrees C was needed for germination and large seeds germinated earlier and better than small seeds. Cold seawater pre-treatment was necessary for good germination; the longer the saline pre-treatment during the natural dormancy period the better the germination. There appeared to be no effect of any specific ion of the seawater pre-treatment on germination and severe hypoxia did not prevent good germination. A short period of freezing stimulated early germination in dry-stored seed. Storage in cold saline or equivalent osmotic medium appeared to inhibit germination during the natural dormancy period and predispose the seed to germinate when the temperature rose and the salinity fell. Seeds that were stored in cold wet conditions germinated better in saline conditions than those stored dry.\nQuestion: Do conditions during dormancy influence germination of Suaeda maritima?",
    "expected_answer": "The conditions under which seeds of S. maritima are stored affect their subsequent germination. Under natural conditions seeds remain dormant in highly saline, anoxic mud and then germinate when the temperature rises above about 15 degrees C and the salinity is reduced.",

We analyzed data from a cohort study of 1,693 Saskatchewan adults who sustained whiplash injuries between July 1, 1994 and December 31, 1994. We investigated 8 initial patterns of care that integrated type of provider (general practitioners, chiropractors, and specialists) and number of visits (low versus high utilization). Cox models were used to estimate the association between patterns of care and time to recovery while controlling for injury severity and other confounders. Patients in the low-utilization general practitioner group and those in the general medical group had the fastest recovery even after controlling for important prognostic factors. Compared with the low-utilization general practitioner group, the 1-year rate of recovery in the high-utilization chiropractic group was 25% slower (adjusted hazard rate ratio [HRR] 0.75, 95% confidence interval [95% CI]0.54-1.04), in the low-utilization general practitioner plus chiropractic group the rate was 26% slower (HRR 0.74, 95% CI 0.60-0.93), and in the high-utilization general practitioner plus chiropractic combined group the rate was 36% slower (HRR 0.64, 95% CI 0.50-0.83).\nQuestion: Early aggressive care and delayed recovery from whiplash: isolated finding or reproducible result?",

The objectives of the present study are (1) to evaluate the effects of a CRP in participants with motor impairment after stroke and (2) to explore the effects of elapsed time from stroke on physiological/quality-of-life outcomes. The CRP included 24 weeks of resistance and aerobic training. Primary outcomes in 120 participants, 25.4\u00b142.3 (mean\u00b1standard deviation) months after stroke, included 6-minute walk distance (6MWD), VO2peak, timed repeated sit-to-stand performance, and affected-side isometric knee extensor strength (IKES). Secondary measures included gait characteristics (cadence, step lengths, and symmetry), walking speed, balance (Berg Balance Scale), affected-side range of motion (ROM), elbow flexor and grip strength, anaerobic threshold, and perceptions of participation/social reintegration. After adjusting for multiple comparisons, participants demonstrated significant improvements (all P<.001) in 6MWD (283.2\u00b1126.6 to 320.7\u00b1141.8 m), sit-to-stand performance (16.3\u00b19.5 to 13.3\u00b17.1 seconds), affected-side IKES (25.9\u00b110.1 to 30.2\u00b111 kg as a percentage of body mass), and VO2peak (15.2\u00b14.5 to 17.2\u00b14.9 mL\u00b7kg\u00b7min(-1)).

In this study, participants living with children were selected (n = 371 women, 352 men). The importance of relative socioeconomic position and perception of gender inequality in the couple relationship in combination with domestic work for psychological distress was examined through logistic regression analysis. Two combinations of variables including socioeconomic position ('having less than half of the responsibility for domestic work and partner higher socioeconomic position' and 'having more than half the responsibility for domestic work and equal socioeconomic position') were related to psychological distress. There were also higher ORs for psychological distress for the combinations of having 'less than half of the responsibility for domestic work and gender-unequal couple relationship' and 'more than half the responsibility for domestic work and gender-unequal couple relationship'.

Our aim was to investigate the rate of nonsyndromic congenital heart defects in newborns exposed in utero to SSRIs compared with unexposed controls. This prospective study of women who gave birth at our tertiary center from 2000 to 2007 yielded 235 women who reported first-trimester SSRI use during pregnancy. All newborns born during the study period and found to have a persistent cardiac murmur on day 2 or 3 of life were referred for examination by a pediatric cardiologist and by echocardiography. The findings were compared between the newborns who were exposed to SSRIs and those who were not. Nonsyndromic congenital heart defects were identified by echocardiography in 8 of 235 (3.40%) newborns exposed in utero to SSRIs and in 1083 of 67,636 (1.60%) non-exposed newborns. The difference in prevalence between the two groups was significant (relative risk, 2.17; 95% confidence interval, 1.07-4.39).

Twenty-one patients were implanted as a bridge to transplantation and 6 for destination therapy. The anticoagulation regimen was fluindione for all patients, with aspirin for only 4 patients. At the beginning of our experience, aspirin was administered to 4 patients for 6, 15, 60 and 460 days. Due to gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and epistaxis, aspirin was discontinued, and since August 2006, no patients have received anti-platelet therapy. At 3 years, the survival rate during support was 76%. The most common postoperative adverse event was GI bleeding (19%) and epistaxis (30%) (median time: 26 days) for patients receiving fluindione and aspirin.

We examined their influence on renal graft function parameters: immediate diuresis, serum creatinine levels, acute rejection, chronic transplant dysfunction, and graft survival. Mean CVP was 9.23 \u00b1 2.65 mm Hg and its variations showed no impact on graft function. We verified a twofold greater risk of chronic allograft dysfunction among patients with CVP \u2265 11 mm Hg (P<.001).

As high tensile stresses increase the fracture risk of ceramic inlays, the objective of the present finite element method (FEM) study was to biomechanically analyze the correlation between inlay thickness (T) and the induced first principal stress. Fourteen ceramic inlay models with varying thickness (0.7-2.0 mm) were generated. All inlays were combined with a CAD model of a first mandibular molar (tooth 46), including the PDL and a mandibular segment which was created by means of the CT data of an anatomical specimen. Two materials were defined for the ceramic inlays (e.max(\u00ae) or empress(\u00ae)) and an occlusal force of 100 N was applied. The first principal stress was measured within each inlay and the peak values were considered and statistically analyzed. The stress medians ranged from 20.7 to 22.1 MPa in e.max(\u00ae) and from 27.6 to 29.2 MPa in empress(\u00ae) inlays. A relevant correlation between the first principal stress and thickness (T) could not be detected, neither for e.max(\u00ae) (Spearman: r=0.028, p=0.001), nor for empress(\u00ae) (Spearman: r=0.010, p=0.221).

Although some works have investigated the possible role of oxidative stress in the pathophysiology of FM, none has analysed a significant number of oxidative markers in the same patients. Consequently, we have performed an exhaustive study of the oxidative/antioxidative status in FM patients and healthy controls, as well as the relationship with FM clinical parameters. In 45 female patients and 25 age-matched controls, we investigated the oxidative (lipid and protein peroxidation, and oxidative DNA damage) and antioxidative status (total antioxidant capacity (TAC), and antioxidant enzyme activities and compounds). Functional capacity and musculoskeletal pain were assessed by Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), respectively. The physical (PCS-12) and mental (MCS-12) health status was evaluated by SF-12. A significant increase in oxidative DNA damage and protein carbonyl content was found in FM patients vs. controls, as well as in antioxidant compounds such as copper and ceruloplasmin. Patients had diminished levels of TAC and zinc. Enzyme activities of superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and catalase were lower in FM patients.

In this study, we sought to assess the impact on clinical trial recruitment of a \u00a3100 incentive payment and whether the offer of this payment attracted more elderly and socially deprived patients. A total of 1,015 potential patients for five clinical trials (SCOT, FAST and PATHWAY 1, 2 and 3) were randomised to receive either a standard trial invitation letter or a trial invitation letter containing an incentive offer of \u00a3100. To receive payment, patients had to attend a screening visit and consent to be screened (that is, sign a consent form). To maintain equality, eventually all patients who signed a consent form were paid \u00a3100. The \u00a3100 incentive offer increased positive response to the first invitation letter from 24.7% to 31.6%, an increase of 6.9% (P\u2009<\u20090.05).

The purpose of the current study was to determine whether early administration of epidural analgesia affects obstetric outcome in nulliparous women who are in spontaneous labor. Informed consent was obtained from 344 healthy nulliparous women with a singleton fetus in a vertex presentation, who requested epidural analgesia during spontaneous labor at at least 36 weeks' gestation. Each patient was randomized to receive either early or late epidural analgesia. Randomization occurred only after the following conditions were met: (1) the patient requested pain relief at that moment, (2) a lumbar epidural catheter had been placed, and (3) the cervix was at least 3 cm but less than 5 cm dilated. Patients in the early group immediately received epidural bupivacaine analgesia. Patients in the late group received 10 mg nalbuphine intravenously. Late-group patients did not receive epidural analgesia until they achieved a cervical dilation of at least 5 cm or until at least 1 h had elapsed after a second dose of nalbuphine. Ten of the 344 patients were excluded because of a protocol violation or voluntary withdrawal from the study. Early administration of epidural analgesia did not increase the incidence of oxytocin augmentation, prolong the interval between randomization and the diagnosis of complete cervical dilation, or increase the incidence of malposition of the vertex at delivery.

Prior research has measured amenity provision through subjective measures (surveying residents' perceptions) or objective (GIS mapping of distance) methods. The latter may provide a more accurate measure of physical access, but residents may not use local amenities if they do not perceive them as 'local'. We believe both subjective and objective measures should be explored, and use West Central Scotland data to investigate correspondence between residents' subjective assessments of how well-placed they are for everyday amenities (food stores, primary and secondary schools, libraries, pharmacies, public recreation), and objective GIS-modelled measures, and examine correspondence by various sub-groups. ArcMap was used to map the postal locations of 'Transport, Health and Well-being 2010 Study' respondents (n = 1760), and the six amenities, and the presence/absence of each of them within various straight-line and network buffers around respondents' homes was recorded. SPSS was used to investigate whether objective presence of an amenity within a specified buffer was perceived by a respondent as being well-placed for that amenity. Kappa statistics were used to test agreement between measures for all respondents, and by sex, age, social class, area deprivation, car ownership, dog ownership, walking in the local area, and years lived in current home. In general, there was poor agreement (Kappa<0.20) between perceptions of being well-placed for each facility and objective presence, within 800 m and 1000 m straight-line and network buffers, with the exception of pharmacies (at 1000 m straight-line) (Kappa: 0.21). Results varied between respondent sub-groups, with some showing better agreement than others.

The prevalence of overweight in early maturers versus the others was 22.6% versus 31.6% in boys and 34.4% versus 23.2% in girls; the figures for obesity were 6.7% versus 14.8% and 15.6% versus 8.1%, respectively. Odd ratios and 95% confidence intervals for obesity were 0.4 (0.2, 0.8) for boys and 2.0 (1.1, 3.5) for girls, and covariates were adjusted. Most significant differences in overweight and obesity among ethnic groups disappeared after controlling for SM. Fatness (BMI and skinfold thickness) was associated with SM stages and with early maturation in boys and girls, but the associations were in opposite directions. Compared with their counterparts, early maturing boys were thinner, whereas early maturing girls were fatter.\nQuestion: Is obesity associated with early sexual maturation?",

A prospective observation study. La Mina Primary Care Centre. Sant Adri\u00e0 de Bes\u00f2s (Barcelona). The on-demand visits of patients over 14 to the General Medicine and Emergency clinics between June 1991 and May 1992 provided the data through a simple multi-stage random sample. On the basis of the clinical notes, these variables were recorded: age, gender, diagnosis, the antibiotic prescribed and its manner of administration. The indication and choice of treatment was assessed in line with previously established criteria, as well as whether the antibiotic was first-choice in Primary Care. Infections treated in hospital or by specialists, non-bacterial cutaneous infections and Conjunctivitis were excluded. Out of 2,523 people examined, 474 presented infectious conditions (18.8%); the most common of these were infections of the upper respiratory tract (46.4%) and acute Bronchitis (17.3%). An antibiotic was prescribed in 206 cases (43.3%). The most used antibiotics were: Amoxicillin (41.5%), Penicillin (19.0%), Cloxacillin (11.2%), Erythromycin (10.2%) and Pipemidic Acid (7.8%). They were orally taken in 89.4% of cases. 92.3% of the antibiotics were first-choice. Overall fitness of treatment was 86.3% (56.5% unnecessary and non-prescribed treatment; and 29.7% necessary and using the recommended antibiotic).

The aim of the present analysis was to examine how far short-term quit rates depend on the practitioner delivering the intervention after adjusting for potential confounding variables. Observational study using routinely collected data. Thirty-one NHS Stop Smoking Services in England. Data from 46,237 one-to-one treatment episodes (supported quit attempts) delivered by specialist practitioners.

Across Africa, there is only one surgeon for every 250,000 people and only one for every 2.5 million of those living in rural areas. Surgical diseases are responsible for approximately 11.2% of the total global burden of disease. Even as the importance of treating surgical disease is being recognized, surgeons in sub-Saharan Africa are leaving rural areas and their countries altogether to practice in more desirable locations. The Pan-African Academy of Christian Surgeons (PAACS) was formed in 1997 as a strategic response to this profound need for surgical manpower. It is training surgical residents through a 5-year American competency-based model. Trainees are required to be of African origin and a graduate of a recognized medical school. To date, PAACS has established six training programs in four countries. During the 2009-2010 academic year, there were 35 residents in training. A total of 18 general surgeons and one pediatric surgeon have been trained. Two more general surgeons are scheduled to finish training in 2011.

We applied the European Society of Urological Oncology algorithm to an independent data set to determine its predictive value. Data on 1,406 men who underwent radical prostatectomy and seminal vesicle removal between 1998 and 2004 were analyzed. Patients with and without seminal vesicle invasion were classified as positive or negative according to the European Society of Urological Oncology algorithm. Of 90 cases with seminal vesicle invasion 81 (6.4%) were positive for 90% sensitivity, while 656 of 1,316 without seminal vesicle invasion were negative for 50% specificity. The negative predictive value was 98.6%. In decision analytic terms if the loss in health when seminal vesicles are invaded and not completely removed is considered at least 75 times greater than when removing them unnecessarily, the algorithm proposed by the European Society of Urological Oncology should not be used.\nQuestion: Is it necessary to remove the seminal vesicles completely at radical prostatectomy?",

Additionally, the biodistribution of two compounds which bind to Glut, 7-[[(2-(3-(125I-p-hydroxyphenyl)propionyl)aminoethyl)amino]carbonyl]-7-+ ++desacetyl-forskolin([125I]HPP forskolin) and [3H]cytochalasin B, were studied in a tumor model which overexpressed Glut. There were multiple classes of binding sites for [3H]cytochalasin B and a percentage of these sites were competitive with D-glucose but not L-glucose. The rank potency and IC50 values for [3H]cytochalasin B binding were: 2-deoxy-D-glucose (4.5 mM)>or = D-glucose (7 mM)>mannose (25 mM)>galactose (35 mM)>rhamnose (1-3 mM)>sorbitol (1-3 mM) and were similar to reported values for transport.

In LX-1 human lung tumor xenograft (LX-1) Glut were 10-to-20-fold higher than other tissues (21.6 +/- 0.6 pmole/mg protein, p<0.01). Immunostaining of Glut-1 was more prominent in LX-1 than other xenograft tumors, consistent with the binding data.

    "prompt": "Answer the question based on the following context: The authors determined the usefulness of frozen section (FS) evaluation in the operative management of follicular lesions of the thyroid. Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) cannot reliably discriminate between benign and malignant follicular lesions of the thyroid. Accordingly, FS evaluation is used routinely to guide intraoperative management. One hundred twenty-five consecutive patients with follicular thyroid lesions who underwent surgical exploration at the Johns Hopkins Hospital were reviewed. Frozen sections were categorized in 104 of 120 patients (87%) as \"follicular lesion, defer to permanent section,\" rendering no useful clinical information. In only 4 of 120 patients (3.3%) did FS evaluation correctly modify the operative procedure. Notably, in six cases (5.0%), an incorrect FS evaluation misled the surgeon, resulting in four misguided operations.\nQuestion: Follicular lesions of the thyroid. Does frozen section evaluation alter operative management?",
    "expected_answer": "Frozen section evaluation is of minimal diagnostic value for follicular thyroid lesions, rendering no additional information 87% of the time; it prolongs the operation, increases costs, and leads to misguided interventions. Until a more definitive diagnostic tool exists for follicular thyroid lesions, FS evaluation could be omitted, resection of the lobe with the nodule could be performed, and the definitive operative management could be based on the final permanent histology.",

From December 2013 to November 2014, a total of 193 patients who needed LC due to AIGB at the four participating hospitals were entered in this study. After the operation, the patients were randomly assigned to undergo drain insertion (94 patients, 48.7%, group A) or not (99 patients, 51.3%, group B). The surgical outcomes between the two groups were prospectively reviewed. The study was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov at the inception of enrollment (NCT02027402). Both groups were comparable in terms of patient demographics, operative time and postoperative hospital stay. In 18 cases (9.3%), postoperative morbidities such as bleeding, bile leakage, wound infection or an abscess occurred, and there was no significant difference between the two groups.

The periodontal status of 15 patients who fulfilled the criteria for primary SS was compared with that of 15 controls with xerostomia who did not fulfill the criteria for primary SS but had similar symptoms of dry mouth. The level of BAFF was measured in paired samples of saliva and serum using in-house enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Periodontitis was assessed by the plaque index, the modified gingival index, the papillary bleeding index, and the periodontal pocket depth. Notwithstanding the better oral hygiene practices of the patients with primary SS compared with those of the xerostomia controls and the subsequent reduction of their plaque index scores, complications of periodontitis, such as bleeding, gingival hypertrophy, and periodontal pockets, were not improved. This failure to ameliorate the complications of periodontitis in patients with primary SS was associated with high levels of BAFF in their saliva compared with the levels in xerostomia controls (7.4 +/- 2.1 versus 1.0 +/- 0.4 ng/ml [P<0.002]).

This paper reports on the iodine concentration of drinking water from sources across Gippsland and examines the contribution of iodine from water to the Gippsland diet. This study also briefly examines the relationship between the concentration of iodine in water and distance from the sea. The cut-off value for water iodine concentrations considered to be indicative of environmental iodine deficiency is<2 \u00b5g L(-1) . The mean iodine concentration of water from 18 Gippsland water treatment plants was 0.38 \u00b5g L(-1) and would therefore make negligible difference to the dietary intake of iodine.

We also assessed the postoperative complications after removal of the partially impacted 3M. A split mouth, randomized clinical study was designed. The study sample included patients with bilateral partially impacted 3Ms. The primary predictor variable was the type of flap design (flaps 1 and 2). The primary outcome variable was periodontal status (gingival recession [GR], probing depth [PD], plaque index [PI], and gingival index) of the 2Ms measured preoperatively and 90 days postoperatively. The secondary outcome variables were postoperative complications, including pain, facial swelling, alveolitis, and local wound infection. The other variables included gender, position of the 3Ms, and surgical difficulty. We performed descriptive, comparative, correlation, and multivariate analyses. The sample included 28 patients aged 18 to 28 years. The GR, PD, and PI values with the flap 2 design were greater than those with the flap 1 design (P<.05). Facial swelling with the flap 1 design was significantly greater than with the flap 2 design on the second postoperative day (P<.05). The pain levels with the flap 1 design were significantly greater than those with the flap 2 design on the first and second postoperative days (P<.05).

Most clinicians believe that anxiety disorder in tandem with a personality disorder often leads to longer treatment, worsens the prognosis, and thus increases treatment costs. Our study was designed to compare the short-term effectiveness of therapy in patients suffering from social phobia with and without personality disorder. The specific aim of the study was to assess the efficacy of a 6 week therapeutic program designed for social phobia (SSRIs and CBT) in patients suffering from social phobia with comorbid personality disorder (17 patients) and social phobia without comorbid personality disorder (18 patients). The patients were regularly assessed in weeks 0, 2, 4 and 6 using the CGI (Clinical Global Improvement) for severity, LSAS (Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale), and in self-assessments BAI (Beck Anxiety Inventory) and BDI (Beck Depression Inventory). Patients in both groups improved their scores in most of the assessment instruments used. A combination of CBT and pharmacotherapy proved to be the most effective treatment for patients suffering with social phobia with or without comorbid personality disorder.

During anal manometry, computerized systems produce several parameters including fatigue rate (FR), which is the basis for calculating the fatigue rate index (FRI). Our aim was to evaluate FR and FRI and their clinical importance in patients suffering from fecal incontinence or severe constipation. All patients scheduled for an anal physiology work-up were included in the study. FR was determined by a computer program and FRI was calculated manually with the following equation: FRI (minutes) = [squeeze pressure (mm Hg) - resting pressure (mmHg)] / - FR (mmHg/min). FR and FRI were compared in patients suffering from fecal incontinence (group I) and severe constipation (group II). Furthermore, subgroups (<50 and>or = 50 years of age) were compared. Lastly, a possible relation between length of the high-pressure zone (HPZ) and FR and FRI was assessed. Between January 2000 and December 2004, 131 patients (96 with fecal incontinence, 35 with constipation) were studied. Both FR and FRI were similar between groups I and II; no significant differences were found when younger and older patients were compared within the same group.

The retrospective cohort included all patients who underwent a nonemergent colectomy from January 1, 2007 to January 1, 2008 at a 2-hospital system. Data collected included patient demographics, patient quality outcomes, complications, and GME involvement. Patient quality outcomes were based on compliance with the Surgical Care Improvement Project (SCIP) guidelines. A total of 159 nonemergent colectomies were analyzed. The GME group accounted for 116 (73%) patients. A significant difference was found in several SCIP process-based measures of quality when comparing the GME group with the non-GME group. Postoperative antibiotics were more likely to be stopped within 24 hours (p = 0.010), and preoperative heparin and postoperative deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis were more likely to be administered (p<0.001). Additionally, patients in the GME group showed improved quality outcomes as there were significantly fewer postoperative complications (p<0.001) and a shorter duration of stay (p = 0.008). The use of gastrointestinal prophylaxis was more common in the non-GME group (p = 0.002).

A randomized patient study was undertaken to evaluate the dose reduction by thyroid lead shields and assess their practicality in a clinical setting. Sixty-five patients attending for endovascular treatment of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) and aneurysms were randomized into one of 2 groups a) No Thyroid Shield and b) Thyroid Lead Shield. Two thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLDs) were placed over the thyroid gland (1 on each side) at constant positions on each patient in both groups. A thyroid lead shield (Pb eq. 0.5 mm) was placed around the neck of patients in the thyroid lead shield group after the neurointerventional radiologist had obtained satisfactory working access above the neck. The total dose-area-product (DAP) value, number and type of digital subtraction angiography (DSA) runs and fluoroscopy time were recorded for all patients.

The incidence and mortality rate in pregnant women with fulminant hepatic failure (FHF) due to hepatitis E virus (HEV) has been reported to be significantly higher, specifically in Asian women. Pregnancy is usually associated with an altered status of sex steroid hormones and immunity. Steroid hormones directly influence the replication through their effects on viral regulatory elements. Moreover, pregnant women in Asia generally suffer from folate deficiency, which is known to cause reduced immunocompetence leading to greater risk of multiple viral infections and higher viral load. To correlate and analyze the viral load and genotypes of HEV in acute liver failure with that of acute viral hepatitis among pregnant and nonpregnant women.

In isolated rat thoracic aorta, however, hemoglobin (Hb), a nitric oxide scavenger, elicited contraction only when the vessels were precontracted with an alpha adrenergic agonist. Does vascular contraction induce endothelial NO release? Thoracic aortic rings from male Sprague-Dawley rats were prepared with or without the endothelium. Vessel rings were contracted with several distinct types of contractile agonists and NO release was probed using a Hb contraction assay in the presence and absence of nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (NAME), a NO synthase inhibitor. In vessel rings precontracted with norepinephrine, potassium chloride, arginine vasopressin, prostaglandin F(2alpha), or serotonin, Hb elicited significant additional contractions. In contrast, Hb failed to elicit significant contractions in vessel rings without the functional endothelium or vessels pretreated with NAME. The Hb mediated additional contraction was not inhibited by calmidazolium, a calmodulin antagonist, and protein kinase inhibitors staurosporine and 2,5-dihydromethylcinnamate. Intercellular gap junction inhibitor 2,3-butanedione monoxime at a low dose (<2 mM) significantly attenuated the NE/Hb mediated contractions but at a high dose (>15 mM) completely prevented both contractions.

The Isfahan Healthy Hearth Programme (IHHP) targeted the entire population of nearly 2 million in urban and rural areas of the intervention communities. One of the main strategies of the lifestyle intervention phase in the IHHP was healthy nutrition. Usual dietary intake was assessed using a forty-nine-item FFQ. A diversity score for each food group was calculated and the DDS was considered the sum of the diversity scores of the food groups. There were significant increases in DDS in both intervention areas (P = 0.0001) after controlling for confounding factors. There was a significant interaction between area and evaluation stage with regard to DDS (P = 0.0001).

A 22-item online survey was sent to 251 PDs in the United States. Appropriate parametric tests determined significance. In all, 105 (42%) PDs responded. No difference existed in response rates among university (56.2%), university-affiliated/community (30.5%), or community (13.3%) program types (p = 0.970). Surgeons alone (46.7%) conducted most endoscopy training with a trend toward multidisciplinary teams (43.8%). A combination of fellowship-trained minimally invasive surgeons and other surgeon types (66.7%) commonly provided laparoscopy training. For adequate endoscopy experience in the future, most PDs (74.3%) plan to require a formal flexible endoscopy rotation (p<0.001). For laparoscopy, PDs intend for more minimally invasive surgery (59%) as well as colon and rectal surgery (53.4%) rotations (both p<0.001).

Data on all LBW infants admitted to George Washington University neonatal intensive care unit and surviving for>48 hrs from January 1992 to March 2003 were analyzed. Males and females were compared for gestational age, birth weight, race, Apgar scores at 1 and 5 mins, peak bilirubin levels, sepsis, and intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH). Significant differences were entered in a regression model to detect the influence of gender on bilirubin (Bili). Analysis was repeated after stratification of infants into: group A,<1000 g; group B, 1000-1499 g; and group C, 1500-2499 g. A total of 840 infants were included in this study.

Traditional administration of systemic antibiotics and antiseptic washing are not necessarily the most effective methods for the prevention of initial biofilm formation on implants in the clinical scenario. In this study an alternative or supplement was sought for preventing or delaying bacterial colonisation and adherence to the outer surface of a breast implant, by establishing an in vitro model for investigating this complex problem. The in vitro antimicrobial activity of several antimicrobial agents was investigated for inhibitory effects on biofilm formation by S. epidermidis. The study consisted of two experiments. The first experiment consisted of two groups (A and B) of seven discs each whilst the second experiment was divided into three groups (C, D and E) of 14 discs each. Each group of 14 consisted of seven smooth and seven textured discs. Discs (biopsies) of each implant were individually coated with one of six different antimicrobial agents. Controls that received no agent were included in the various experimental groups. In the first experiment disc diffusion sensitivity testing was performed and inhibition zone sizes were measured. In the second experiment the discs were cultured in broth. The degree of biofilm formation was evaluated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). In the first in vitro experiment, all six agents showed a measurable antimicrobial effect against the biofilm-forming strain of S. epidermidis when compared to the effect against the American Type Culture Collection strain.

We estimate the effect of a practice becoming PCMH-certified on ED visits and costs using a difference-in-differences approach which exploits variation in the timing of PCMH certification, employing either practice or patient fixed effects. We analyzed patients with and without chronic illness across six chronic illness categories. Among chronically ill patients, transition to PCMH status was associated with 5-8 percent reductions in ED utilization.

The aim of this study is to explore the relationship between religiousness and death attitudes on the one hand and wish to die on the other hand, adjusting for clinical factors such as the presence of depression or somatic disorder. The sample comprised 113 older inpatients (from a psychiatric and somatic ward) with a mean age of 74 years. Psychiatric diagnoses were assessed by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Disorders, and logistic regression analyses estimated the unique contribution of religiousness and death attitudes to the wish to die, controlling for socio-demographic variables, depressive disorder, and somatic symptoms. Both religiousness and death attitudes were associated with a wish to die in univariate models. Adding these variables in a multivariate logistic hierarchical model, death attitudes remained significant predictors but religiousness did not; 55% of the pseudovariance of the wish to die was explained by these variables, with an effective size of 0.89.

    "prompt": "Answer the question based on the following context: Central venous catheter (CVC)-related infections are a substantial problem in the intensive care unit (ICU). Our infection control team initiated the routine use of antiseptic-coated (chlorhexidine-silver sulfadiazine; Chx-SS) CVCs in our adult ICUs to reduce catheter-associated (CA) and catheter-related (CR) blood stream infection (BSI) as we implemented other educational and best practice standardization strategies. Prior randomized studies documented that the use of Chx-SS catheters reduces microbial colonization of the catheter compared with an uncoated standard (Std) CVC but does not reduce CR-BSI. We therefore implemented the routine use of uncoated Std CVCs in our surgical ICU (SICU) and examined the impact of this change. The use of uncoated Std CVCs does not increase CR-BSI rate in an SICU. Prospective evaluation of universal use of uncoated Std CVCs, implemented November 2007 in the SICU. The incidences of CA-BSI and CR-BSI were compared during November 2006-October 2007 (universal use of Chx-SS CVCs) and November 2007-October 2008 (universal use of Std CVCs) by t-test. The definitions of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were used for CA-BSI and CR-BSI. Patient data were collected via a dedicated Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) III coordinator for the SICU. Annual use of CVCs increased significantly in the last six years, from 3,543 (2001) to 5,799 (2006) total days. The APACHE III scores on day 1 increased from a mean of 54.4 in 2004 to 55.6 in 2008 (p\u2009=\u20090.0010; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.29-5.13). The mean age of the patients was unchanged over this period, ranging from 58.2 to 59.6 years. The Chx-SS catheters were implemented in the SICU in 2002. Data regarding the specific incidence of CR-BSI were collected beginning at the end of 2005, with mandatory catheter tip cultures when CVCs were removed. Little difference was identified in the incidence of BSI between the interval with universal Chx-SS use and that with Std CVC use. (Total BSI 0.7 vs. 0.8 per 1,000 catheter days; CA-BSI 0.5 vs. 0.8 per 1,000 catheter days; CR-BSI 0.2 vs. 0 per 1,000 catheter days.) No difference was seen in the causative pathogens of CA-BSI or CR-BSI.\nQuestion: Prevention of catheter-related blood stream infection: back to basics?",
    "expected_answer": "Eliminating the universal use of Chx-SS-coated CVCs in an SICU with a low background incidence of CR-BSIs did not result in an increase in the rate of CR-BSIs.

In statin-treated patients with residual elevated low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels the physician must decide whether to switch to a more potent statin or try and achieve better adherence. We examined the association between adherence and LDL-C within low, moderate and high intensity statin groups in a \"real world\" setting. We assessed annual adherence by the mean MPR (Medication Possession Ratio = number of purchased/prescribed daily doses) in unselected patient group. Statins were stratified (ACC/AHA Guideline) into low, moderate and high intensity groups. The impact of adherence on LDL levels was assessed by LOESS (locally weighted scatter plot smoothing). Out of 1183 patients 173 (14.6%) were treated with low, 923 (78.0%) with moderate and 87 (7.4%) with high intensity statins. Statin intensity was inversely associated with adherence (MPR 77\u00b121, 73\u00b122 and 69\u00b121% for low, moderate and high intensity respectively, p=0.018). Non-adjusted LDL levels decreased with higher adherence: a 10% adherence increase resulted in LDL decrease of 3.5, 5.8 and 7.1mg/dL in low, moderate and high intensity groups.

During the period in question, the exclusion criteria for this implant were primary THAs with severe acetabular or femoral bone defect and revision THAs. Of these, 94 hips (95%) in 91 patients were available for analysis at a minimum of 5 years (range, 5-6 years), because five patients (six hips) had died. Mean age at the time of arthroplasty was 55 \u00b1 14 years. Prostheses with an identical design and Biolox(\u00ae) Delta ceramics were used in all patients. Noise was classified into squeaking, clicking, grinding, and popping. Ceramic fracture, dislocation, and any other complications associated with the use of AMC ceramics were also investigated. Clinical evaluation included the modified HHS preoperatively and at each followup. Survivorship free from reoperation and revision was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Of 91 patients, four developed bearing-related complications, including one with liner dissociation despite initial square seating and three with clicking. No patients had ceramic fractures. A single event of perioperative dislocation occurred in one patient and postoperative periprosthetic fracture occurred in two hips.

Recent studies showed that fibrosis in LF hypertrophy was due to accumulation of inflammation-related scar tissue. PDGF-BB participates in scar formation and collagen development in wound healing and fibrosis diseases. However, it is unclear whether PDGF-BB expression is associated with fibrosis of the hypertrophied LF in LSS. In all, 10 patients of LSS was enrolled in this study, while 10 patients of lumbar disc herniation (LDH) as a control group. LF thickness was measured by axial T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. Fibrosis was graded and type of collagen was identified. The location and the expression of PDGF-BB were analyzed using immunohistochemical stains, real-time polymerase chain reaction, and Western Blotting. Correlation among LF thickness, fibrosis, and PDGF-BB expression was analyzed. LF thickness was 5.3 \u00b1 1.0 mm (range from 3.9 to 7.5 mm) in the LSS group and 2.8 \u00b1 0.7 mm (range from 1.69 to 3.8 mm) in the LDH group.

The aim of our investigation was to examine the role of renal anaemia in oxidative stress in HD patients. MDA and 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE) were measured in three groups of patients undergoing HD: group I comprised eight patients with a blood haemoglobin (Hb)<10 g/dl (mean Hb = 8.1+/-1.3 g/dl), and group II were eight patients with a Hb>10 g/dl (mean Hb=12.4+/-1.9g/dl); none of these 16 patients had been treated with human recombinant erythropoietin (rHuEpo). Group III comprised 27 patients with a mean Hb of 10.5+/-1.6 g/dl after long-term rHuEpo treatment.

The aim of this study is to review the role of gated 99Tc-methoxyisobutylisonitrile myocardial perfusion scintigraphy (G-MPS) in the diagnosis and follow-up of the patients with myocarditis in comparison with gallium scintigraphy. Thirteen patients with a clinical diagnosis of myocarditis were included in the study. All underwent rest G-MPS and the images were then evaluated by quantitative perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography and quantitative gated single photon emission computed tomography software program. Visual evaluation of perfusion was performed as well as analysis of motion with thickening function [expressed as summed rest score, summed motion score, and summed thickening score (STS)] with calculation of ejection fraction (EF) and lung-to-heart (L/H) ratio. Eight patients underwent 67Ga scintigraphy. Clinical, echocardiography, and cardiac enzymes (creatinine kinase-MB, myoglobulin, troponin T, brain natriuretic peptide) data were gathered from the patients' charts. Clinical outcome was grouped according to prognosis. Spearman's correlation (SC) test was used for comparison analysis. Myocardial perfusion defects were observed in eight patients. Perfusion defects in the left ventricle involve a mean of 7.25% (range: 1-11%), whereas wall motion abnormality on G-MPS was more prominent, which showed to be a better marker for myocardial inflammation and necrosis. The 67Ga scintigraphy findings were normal in all, but two. The G-MPS EF (33+/-21%) was slightly lower than the echocardiography EF (40+/-15%), but with close correlation (SC coefficient: 0.635). Comparison of scintigraphic findings with clinical parameters showed that summed motion score with G-MPS EF and STS with L/H ratios were highly correlated (0.932 and 0.622, respectively).

Strain, a measure of the local relative deformation in a structure, corresponds to the mechanical stimulus that governs bone remodeling and is therefore a useful in vitro biomechanical measure for assessing the response of bone to new implant designs and materials. A polyetheretherketone (PEEK) femoral implant has the potential to promote bone strains closer to that of natural bone as a result of its low elastic modulus compared with cobalt-chromium (CoCr).QUESTIONS/ In the present study, we used a Digital Image Correlation (DIC) technique to answer the following question: Does a PEEK TKA femoral component induce a more physiologically normal bone strain distribution than a CoCr component? To achieve this, a DIC test protocol was developed for periprosthetic bone strain assessment using an analog model; the protocol aimed to minimize errors in strain assessment through the selection of appropriate analysis parameters. Three synthetic bone femurs were used in this experiment. One was implanted with a CoCr femoral component and one with a PEEK femoral component. The third (unimplanted) femur was intact and used as the physiological reference (control) model. All models were subjected to standing loads on\u00a0the corresponding polyethylene (ultrahigh-molecular-weight polyethylene) tibial component,\u00a0and speckle image data were acquired for surface strain analysis using DIC in six repeat tests. The strain in 16 regions of interest on the lateral surface of each of the implanted bone models was plotted for comparison with the corresponding strains in the intact case. A Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to test for difference at the 5% significance level. Surface analog bone strain after CoCr implantation indicated strain shielding (R2= 0.6178 with slope, \u03b2 = 0.4314) and was lower than the intact case (p = 0.014). The strain after implantation with the PEEK implant deviated less from the intact case (R2= 0.7972 with slope \u03b2 = 0.939) with no difference (p = 0.231).\nQuestion: Does a PEEK Femoral TKA Implant Preserve Intact Femoral Surface Strains Compared With CoCr?",

We hypothesized that surgical treatment for diverticulitis has decreased resulting in proportionately more complicated diverticulitis cases (free perforation and/or abscess). We conducted a retrospective analysis of patients with diverticular disease in the Nationwide Inpatient Sample from 1991 through 2005. We used diagnostic codes to identify all patient discharges with diverticular disease and then determined the proportion of discharges with diverticulitis, perforated disease, diverticular abscess, and surgical treatment. During the study period, 685,390 diverticulitis discharges were recorded. The ratio of diverticulitis discharges increased from 5.1 cases per 1,000 inpatients in 1991 to 7.6 cases per 1,000 inpatients in 2005 (P<0.0001). The proportion of patients who underwent colectomy for uncomplicated diverticulitis declined from 17.9% in 1991 to 13.7% in 2005 (P<0.0.0001). During the same period, the proportion of free diverticular perforations as a fraction of all diverticulitis cases remained unchanged (1.5%). The proportion of diverticular abscess discharges as a fraction of all diverticulitis cases increased from 5.9% in 1991 to 9.6% in 2005 (P<0.0001).

    "prompt": "Answer the question based on the following context: There is accumulating evidence that greater availability of green space in a neighbourhood is associated with health benefits for the local population. One mechanism proposed for this association is that green space provides a venue for, and therefore encourages, physical activity. It has also been suggested that socio-economic health inequalities may be narrower in greener areas because of the equalised opportunity for physical activity green spaces provide. However, research exploring associations between the availability of green space and physical activity has produced mixed results. Limits to the assessment of the type and amount of physical activity which occurs specifically in green space may account for these mixed findings. This observational study was therefore concerned with the extent to which green space is a venue for physical activity and whether this could account for narrower socio-economic health inequalities in greener neighbourhoods. Secondary analysis of cross sectional data on 3679 adults (16+) living in urban areas across Scotland matched with a neighbourhood level measure of green space availability. Associations between green space availability and both total physical activity, and activity specifically within green space, were explored using logistic regression models. Interactions between socio-economic position and physical activity were assessed. All models adjusted for age, sex and household income. The availability of green space in a neighbourhood was not associated with total physical activity or that specifically in green space. There was no evidence that income-related inequalities in physical activity within green space were narrower in greener areas of Scotland.\nQuestion: Is level of neighbourhood green space associated with physical activity in green space?",

However, this evidence is mostly based on retrospective studies and has provided conflicting results. No study reported cause-specific mortality according to body mass index (BMI) in ACS. We aimed to prospectively assess the impact of BMI on mortality and its specific causes in ACS patients. We included non-selected ACS patients admitted in a tertiary care coronary unit, collecting baseline characteristics, management and clinical course. Patients were stratified into five clinically meaningful BMI subgroups of<20, 20-24.9, 25-29.9, 30-35,>35 kg/m(2). The primary outcome was 1 year mortality, its causes and its association with BMI. This association was assessed by the Cox regression method. We included 2040 patients in our study with a mean age of 62.1 years. Low weight patients (BMI<20) were older, with less cardiovascular risk factors, higher prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and worse renal function. Mean follow up was 334 days. The unadjusted analysis showed lower all-cause mortality in all subgroups as compared to low weight patients. After adjusting for potential confounders, this association remained significant for patients with a BMI 20-24.9. Cardiac mortality was similar across BMI subgroups. In contrast, the adjusted analysis showed a significantly lower non-cardiac mortality in patients with a BMI 20-24.9, 25-29.9 and 30-35 as compared to low weight patients.\nQuestion: Body mass index and acute coronary syndromes: paradox or confusion?",

The diagnosis of headache in children was made on the basis of the criteria of the International Headache Society (IHS). If the parents of a child diagnosed with headache reported that their child had headache, the parent was evaluated to be aware of his/her child's headache. In the statistical analyses, chi-square and binary logistic regression were used. Almost 74% of parents were aware of their children's headache. It was found that migraine type headache, female gender, being the first child of the family, travel sickness of children, the presence of headache history in one of the family members; the number of family members and mother's age are factors that affect the awareness level of parents.

We investigated the relationship between failure of the left-molar approach and preoperative risk factors for difficult intubation. With local ethics committee approval, 200 consecutive adult, nonpregnant patients were included in the study. The demographic data, body mass index, Mallampati modified score, interincisor gap, and mentohyoid and thyromental distances were measured preoperatively. First, the Macintosh blade was inserted using the midline approach, and then optimal external laryngeal manipulation (OELM) was applied. Second, the blade was inserted using the left-molar approach. The glottic views were assessed according to the Cormack-Lehane classification before and after OELM in both approaches. In cases where tracheal intubation failed with the left-molar approach, the midline approach was applied again and endotracheal intubation took place. The grade I glottic view obtained using the midline approach without OELM did not change in 94.3% of the patients with the left-molar approach without OELM; in addition, the grade II glottic view improved to grade I in 52.8% of the patients with the same technique (P<0.001). Although the number of patients with a grade I or II glottic view in the left-molar approach was 197, only 37 patients could be intubated using the left-molar approach. In addition, 59.5% of them were intubated at the second attempt with the left-molar approach, while the incidence of a second attempt was 1.2% with the midline approach (P<0.001).

We report on the feasibility of implementing screening for recruiting distressed cancer patients to a randomized controlled trial of problem-solving therapy (PST), characteristics associated with enrolment, and time investment and challenges of implementing screening. Three medical settings implemented screening of patients, directly after cancer treatment (T1) and 2 months later (T2), using Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25 and one question about need for services. Distressed patients indicating need for services were interviewed. Eligible patients were offered the possibility to participate in the trial. Consenting patients were randomized to PST or waitlist. At T1, 366 of 970 screened patients (37%) scored above the cutoff and at T2, 208 of 689 screened patients (30%). At either or both T1 and T2, 423 patients reported distress, of whom 215 indicated need for services. Only 36 (4% of 970) patients consented to trial participation. Twenty-seven patients needed to be screened to recruit a single patient, with 17 h required for each patient recruited.

Since the renaissance of laser prostatectomy with the advent of the holmium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet laser in the 1990s, various lasers and subsequent procedures have been introduced. These techniques can be categorized as vaporizing, resecting, and enucleating approaches. Photoselective vaporization of the prostate (PVP) is dominated by high-power lithium triborate (LBO) crystal lasers (GreenLight XPS). The mainstay of this technique is for the treatment of small to medium prostate volumes whereas enucleating techniques, such as holmium laser enucleation of the prostate and thulium enucleation of the prostate, focus on large-volume glands. In order to perspectively \"delimit\" LBO into the field of large-volume prostates, we developed LBO en bloc enucleation to render it as a competing transurethral enucleating approach. We present a detailed stepwise progressive technique developed in Madrid, Spain, for the complete removal of the transitional zone by vapoenucleation. The steps include exposition of the prostatic capsule by PVP toward the peripheral zone, thereby identifying the anatomical limits of enucleation.

A database of readmissions within 30 days of discharge between April 2009 and September 2010 was retrospectively reviewed. Clinical and administrative variables associated with readmission were examined, including age, sex, race, days between discharge and readmission, and insurance type. The readmissions were then assigned independently by 2 neurosurgeons into 1 of 3 categories: scheduled, adverse event, and unrelated. The adverse event readmissions were further subcategorized into patients readmitted although best practices were followed, those readmitted due to progression of their underlying disease, and those readmitted for preventable causes. These variables were compared descriptively. A total of 348 patients with 407 readmissions were identified, comprising 11.5% of the total 3552 admissions. The median age of readmitted patients was 55 years (range 16-96 years) and patients older than 65 years totaled 31%. There were 216 readmissions (53% of 407) for management of an adverse event that was classified as either preventable (149 patients; 37%) or unpreventable (67 patients; 16%). There were 113 patients (28%) who met readmission criteria but who were having an electively scheduled neurosurgical procedure. Progression of disease (48 patients; 12%) and treatment unrelated to primary admission (30 patients; 7%) were additional causes for readmission.

Such findings suggest that dopamine receptors might mediate part of the capacity of inhaled anesthetics to provide immobility in the face of noxious stimulation. We measured the effect of blockade of D2 dopamine-mediated transmission with 0.3 mg/kg or 3.0 mg/kg droperidol on the MAC of cyclopropane, desflurane, halothane, isoflurane, or sevoflurane in rats, and the effect of 3.0 mg/kg droperidol on the dose or concentration of etomidate (an anesthetic known to act principally by enhancing the response of gamma-aminobutyric acid(A) receptors to gamma-aminobutyric acid) required to suppress movement in response to noxious stimulation.

During coinfection studies with Salmonella typhimurium and Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) in major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-congenic mice, we conducted the proper F2 controls and discovered significant differences between these F2 animals and MHC-genotype-matched P0 and F1 animals in weight gain and pathogen load. To systematically evaluate the apparent non-MHC differences in these mice, we infected all three generations (P0, F1 and F2) for 5 MHC genotypes (b/b, b/q and q/q as well as d/d, d/q, and q/q) with Salmonella and TMEV. Infected P0 MHC q/q congenic homozygotes lost significantly more weight (p = 0.02) and had significantly higher Salmonella (p<0.01) and TMEV (p = 0.02) titers than the infected F2 q/q homozygotes.

Our principal measure of significant cardiologist treatment was whether a patient was admitted by a cardiologist. We use supplemental data to explore whether our analysis would differ substantially using alternative definitions of significant cardiologist treatment. This retrospective cohort study compared results using least squares (LS) multivariate regression with results from IV methods that accounted for additional unmeasured patient characteristics. Primary outcomes were 30-day and one-year mortality, and secondary outcomes included treatment with medications and revascularization procedures.DATA COLLECTION/ Medical charts for the initial hospital stay of each AMI patient underwent a comprehensive abstraction, including dates of hospitalization, admitting physician, demographic characteristics, comorbid conditions, severity of clinical presentation, electrocardiographic and other diagnostic test results, contraindications to therapy, and treatments before and after AMI. Patients admitted by cardiologists had fewer comorbid conditions and less severe AMIs. These patients had a 10 percent (95 percent CI: 9.5-10.8 percent) lower absolute mortality rate at one year. After multivariate adjustment with LS regression, the adjusted mortality difference was 2 percent (95 percent CI: 1.4-2.6 percent).

Patients admitted by a cardiologist were also significantly more likely to have a cardiologist consultation within the first day of admission and during the initial hospital stay, and also had a significantly larger share of their physician bills for inpatient treatment from cardiologists.

The study included men presenting with LUTS and a PVR of>250 mL who, because of significant comorbidity, a low symptom score or patient request, were managed conservatively and prospectively, and were followed with symptom assessment, serum creatinine levels, flow rates and renal ultrasonography. Patients were actively managed if there was a history of previous outflow tract surgery, prostate cancer, urethral strictures, neuropathy, elevated creatinine or hydronephrosis. In all, 93 men (mean age 70 years, range 40-84) with a median (range) PVR of 363 mL (250-700) were included in the study and followed for 5 (3-10) years. At presentation, the median maximum flow rate was 10.2 (3-30) mL/s and the voided volume 316 (89-714) mL. The measured PVR remained stable in 47 (51%), reduced in 27 (29%) and increased in 19 (20%) patients; 31 patients (33%) went on to transurethral resection of the prostate after a median of 30 (10-120) months, because of serum creatinine elevation (two), acute retention (seven), increasing PVR (eight) and worsening symptoms (14). Of 31 patients 25 were available for evaluation after surgery; their median PVR was 159 (0-1000) mL, flow rate 18.4 (4-37) mL/s and voided volume 321 (90-653) mL. Symptoms were improved in all but five men. There was no difference in initial flow rate, voided volume or PVR between those who developed complications or went on to surgery and those who did not.

To examine the role of spinal instrumentation during the healing process of posterolateral fusion. In long bone fractures, internal fixation improves the union rate but does not accelerate the healing process. Spinal instrumentation also improves the fusion rate in spinal arthrodesis. However, it remains unclear whether the use of spinal instrumentation expedites the healing process of spinal fusion. Sixteen sheep underwent posterolateral spinal arthrodeses at L2-L3 and L4-L5 using equal amounts of autologous bone. One of those segments was selected randomly to be augmented with transpedicular screw fixation (Texas Scottish Rite Hospital spinal system). The animals were killed at 8 weeks or 16 weeks after surgery. Fusion status was evaluated by biomechanical testing, manual palpation, plain radiography, computed tomography, and histology. Instrumented fusion segments demonstrated significantly higher stiffness than did uninstrumented fusions at 8 weeks after surgery. Radiographic assessment and manual palpation showed that the use of spinal instrumentation improved the fusion rate at 8 weeks (47% versus 38% in radiographs, 86% versus 57% in manual palpation). Histologically, the instrumented fusions consisted of more woven bone than the uninstrumented fusions at 8 weeks after surgery.

As demonstrated in a previous work, PNIF is influenced by SEX, AGE and HEIGHT. However there is a large degree of between-patient variability in PNIF levels. The purpose of this analysis is to determine whether the measurement of the pulmonary ventilatory capacity, by mean of Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF), enables more precise determination of PNIF. Repeated measurements of PNIF and PEF were performed in 112 volunteers. 100 of these fulfilled the study criteria (55 females and 45 males) and all of them were non-smokers, non-asthmatic, without nose and paranasal sinuses problems, with ages ranging from 15 to 71 years. Statistical analysis was undertaken to determine whether a relationship existed between PNIF and age, sex and height, but which also considered PEF. The data from both experiments were analysed together. In both groups there is a clear tendency for PNIF to increase with PEF. As clearly demonstrated in this work the value of PEF is informative in predicting PNIF and that the larger the value of PEF, the larger the value of PNIF.\nQuestion: Does peak nasal inspiratory flow relate to peak expiratory flow?",
    "expected_answer": "PNIF is a useful method to study nasal patency in both primary and secondary care to aid diagnosis of nasal disease, but low values of PNIF have to be confirmed by a study of the PEF as PNIF low values may be an expression of low ventilatory activity rather than an expression of nasal obstruction.",

The expression of these proteins, among many others, is being deregulated in tumorogenesis. The aim of this study was to investigate whether cyclin E, pRb, and p21 can be used as prognostic indicators in gastric cancer. Fifty-six patients with gastric adenocarcinoma, who underwent curative resection, constituted the group of our study. The immunohistochemical expression of cyclin E, pRb, and p21 proteins was examined and correlated with clinical-pathological parameters and survival. Positive cyclin E immunostaining was observed in 23 tumors (41.1%). It was associated with intestinal Lauren classification (P=0.003), nodal infiltration (P=0.0025), size of the tumor>5 cm (P=0.032), and lymphatic (P=0.042) and vascular invasion (P= 0.0029). Nevertheless, the survival of patients with positive cyclin E tumors was not significantly shorter than that of negative patients. Positive pRb immunostaining was found in 24 (42.9%) cases and it was associated with the absence of Helicobacter pylori (P=0.044), whereas positive p21 immunostaining was found in 21 tumors (37.5%) and it was associated with less depth of gastric wall infiltration (P=0.001), the absence of lymphatic (P=0.019) and vascular infiltration (P=0.024), and the absence of liver metastasis (P=0.044).

A typical clinical case is also summarized. All cases of statin-associated rhabdomyolysis reported to Health Canada's Canadian Vigilance Program and to the US Food and Drug Administration's Adverse Event Reporting System from 2004-2008 were analyzed by severity and dose equivalence. Canadian national statin utilization data from 2002-2007 were used to estimate the dose-related incidence of rhabdomyolysis corrected for levels of utilization.

Mean tumor size was 17.2 +/- 1.1 mm. The overall outcome was quite good with a survival rate of 97% and a recurrence rate of 12%. On univariate analysis, there was no difference amongst the groups in regards to age or gender. However, there was a significantly higher incidence of lymph node metastasis amongst those with the largest tumors. Consequently, those patients with the largest tumors were treated more aggressively, with 75% undergoing total thyroidectomies and 85% receiving radioactive iodine therapy.

The aim of this double-blind, randomized controlled trial was to evaluate the efficacy of an adjuvant blockade of the ilioinguinal nerve using ultrasound (US) guidance at the end of the procedure with local anesthetic vs normal saline and to explore the potential for prolongation of analgesia with decreased need for postoperative pain medication. Fifty children ages 1-6 years scheduled for unilateral inguinal hernia repair, hydrocelectomy, orchidopexy, or orchiectomy were prospectively randomized into one of two groups: Group S that received an US-guided ilioinguinal nerve block with 0.1 ml x kg(-1) of preservative-free normal saline and Group B that received an US-guided nerve block with 0.1 ml x kg(-1) of 0.25% bupivacaine with 1 : 200,000 epinephrine at the conclusion of the surgery.

The WA Data Linkage System was used to extract all hospital morbidity records in Western Australia from 1981 to 2001. The adjusted annual incidence rate ratio of hospitalisation as a privately insured patient versus a public (Medicare) patient was estimated using Poisson regression in each clinical category across three age groups in each year. The rate ratios were graphed as segmented trend lines and compared with published data for trends in PHI membership. The most significant changes in the use of PHI versus the public system occurred between 1981 and 1984 overall clinical categories. These changes were consistent with those documented for PHI membership. From 1992 onwards, significant changes in the trend were observed in the surgical clinical category, compared with the medical and obstetric clinical categories. Further, the trend observed in the surgical clinical category at this time was inconsistent with that documented for PHI membership.

Diagnosis of past or current autism or PDD was made according to the DSM-IV criteria. COS patients with and without PDD were compared with respect to neuropsychological, clinical, and neurobiological measures. Several candidate genes for autism were examined in the entire COS sample and the subgroup with PDD using the Transmission Disequilibrium Test (TDT) and Quantitative TDT (QTDT). Nineteen (25%) of COS probands had a lifetime diagnosis of PDD: one met criteria for autism, two for Asperger's disorder, and 16 for PDD not otherwise specified.

In the first approach, the strength of DMN region inter-connectivity (as expressed with correlation coefficients) was of primary interest, the second method provided a measure of the magnitude of DMN co-activation.

Delving into the nature of this association is vital, since various underlying factors may contribute to the expression of aggression. This study examined trait aggression by assessing correlates and, subsequently, the unique contribution of alcohol craving, and dysfunctional impulsivity, by means of correlational and mediational analyses. Forty inpatient detoxified alcohol-dependent patients were recruited. These participants completed the Desire for Alcohol Questionnaire (DAQ), Dickman Impulsivity Inventory (DII), and the Aggression Questionnaire (AQ). The findings indicated that aggression, dysfunctional impulsivity, and alcohol craving were all positively intercorrelated. The association between dysfunctional impulsivity and aggression was robust. The mediational analyses yielded that craving partially mediated this relationship, although not very substantial.\nQuestion: Does alcohol craving mediate the impulsivity-aggression relationship in recently detoxified alcohol-dependent patients?",

We aimed to estimate how alternative FIT strategies that use a lower than usual positivity threshold followed by a longer screening interval compare with conventional strategies. We analysed longitudinal data of 4523 Dutch individuals (50-74\u2005years at baseline) participating in round I of a one-sample FIT screening programme, of which 3427 individuals also participated in round II after 1-3\u2005years. The cohort was followed until 2\u2005years after round II. In both rounds, a cut-off level of \u226550\u2005ng haemoglobin (Hb)/mL buffer (corresponding to 10\u2005\u00b5g Hb/g faeces) was used, representing the standard scenario. We determined the cumulative positivity rate (PR) and the numbers of subjects diagnosed with advanced adenomas (N_AdvAd) and early stage CRC (N_earlyCRC) in the cohort over two rounds of screening (standard scenario) and compared it with hypothetical single-round screening with use of a lower cut-off and omission of the second round (alternative scenario). In the standard scenario, the cumulative (ie, round I and II combined) PR, N_AdvAd and N_earlyCRC were 13%, 180% and 26%, respectively. In alternative scenarios using a cut-off level of respectively \u226511 and \u226522\u2005ng/HbmL buffer (corresponding to 2 and 4\u2005\u00b5g Hb/g faeces), the PRs were 18% and 13%, the N_AdvAd were 180 and 162 and the N_earlyCRC ranged between 22-27 and 22-26.\nQuestion: Immunochemical faecal occult blood testing to screen for colorectal cancer: can the screening interval be extended?",

The subsidiary aim is to explore whether non-pharmaceutical expenditures also changed. Data on ALL Kids enrollees between 1999-2007, obtained from claims files and the state's administrative database. We used data on children who were enrolled between one and three years both before and after the changes to the copayment schedule, and estimate regression models with individual-level fixed effects to control for time-invariant heterogeneity at the child level. This allows an accurate estimate of how program expenditures change for the same individual following copayment changes. Primary outcomes of interest are expenditures for prescription drugs by class and brand-name and generic versions. We estimate models for the likelihood of any use of prescription drugs and expenditure level conditional on use. Following the copayment increase, the probability of any expenditure decline by 5.8%, brand name drugs by 6.9%, generic drugs by 7.4%. Conditional on any use, program expenditures decline by 7.9% for all drugs, by 9.6% for brand name drugs, and 6.2% for generic drugs. The largest declines are for antihistamine drugs; the least declines are for Central Nervous System agents. Declines are smaller and statistically weaker for children with chronic health conditions.

A quantitative study based on a self-completion survey questionnaire completed in 2010. Nurses employed in two UK National Health Service Foundation Trusts were surveyed and assessed using seven work-related constructs and various demographics including age generation. Through correlation, multiple regression and stepwise regression analysis, the potential combined effect of various explanatory variables on continuation intention was assessed, across the entire nursing cohort and in three age-generation groups. Three variables act in combination to explain continuation intention: work-family conflict, work attachment and importance of work to the individual. This combination of significant explanatory variables was consistent across the three generations of nursing employee. Work attachment was identified as the strongest marginal predictor of continuation intention.\nQuestion: Do nurses wish to continue working for the UK National Health Service?",

The aim of this study was to assess the incidence of esophageal abnormalities as a cause of retrosternal chest pain in patients with previously documented coronary artery disease. Thirty consecutive patients were studied, all of whom had undergone coronary arteriography. The patients were studied after they were admitted to the coronary care unit with an attack of typical chest pain.

The mechanism of this interaction has not been well understood. This was a prospective cross-sectional study. We evaluated 72 male patients older than 60 years admitted to a geriatric rehabilitation unit. Subjects with severe hepatic or renal diseases were excluded. We measured body mass index, caloric intake, serum albumin, prealbumin, cholesterol, transferrin, hemoglobin, and total lymphocyte count. To detect inflammation, we measured C-reactive protein, Westergren sedimentation rate, fibrinogen, and cytokines including tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), IL-6, IL-2, and the soluble IL-2 receptor. Soluble IL-2 receptor was negatively associated with albumin (r = -.479, p<.0001), prealbumin (r = -.520, p =<.0001), cholesterol (r = -.487, p = .0001), transferrin (r = -.455, p = .0002), and hemoglobin (r = -.371, p = .002). TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, and IL-2 were not associated with these measures.\nQuestion: Is malnutrition overdiagnosed in older hospitalized patients?",

Data on reasons for referral and somatic and psychiatric diagnoses were collected. Using a global clinical assessment scale and the Health of the Nations Outcome Scales (HoNOS), data on psychiatric symptomology and limitations, behavioural problems, social problems and limitations associated with physical health problems were collected on both admission and discharge. In this way the effect of the admission period on various problems was determined. In 2011 there were 139 admissions to the MPU with a wide variation of somatic and psychiatric diagnoses. The average admission period was 9 days. Global clinical evaluation of the treatment goals set for somatic and psychiatric conditions showed that more than 90% and 85% of the treatment goals, respectively, were completely achieved. HoNOS scores showed a reduction in severity of both psychiatric and somatic problems.

The National Service Framework for Mental Health (published by the Department of Health, 1999) states that people with depression should continue to be predominantly managed in primary care. There is much evidence that the detection and management of depression by GPs could be improved, but little work has focused on GPs' views of their work with depressed patients. This was a qualitative study exploring GP attitudes to the management of patients with depression. Views of GPs in socio-economically deprived areas are compared with those serving more affluent populations. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with two groups of GPs in north-west England. One group of GPs (22) were practising in inner-city areas, and a second group (13) in suburban and semi-rural practices. All were Principals in practices that participated in undergraduate teaching. The interviews were audio-taped and subsequently transcribed verbatim. Analysis was by constant comparison until category saturation of each theme was achieved. Subjects conceptualized depression as an everyday problem of practice, rather than as an objective diagnostic category. Thematic coding of their accounts suggests a tension between three kinds of views of depressed people: (i) That depression is a common and normal response to life events or change and that it reflects the medicalization of these conditions; (ii) That the label or diagnosis of depression offers a degree of secondary gain to both patients and doctors, particularly to those GPs practising in inner-city areas and (iii) That inner-city GPs experienced on-going management of depressed people as an interactional problem, in contrast to those GPs serving a less deprived population who saw depression as a treatable illness and as rewarding work for the GP.\nQuestion: Managing depression in primary care: another example of the inverse care law?",
    "expected_answer": "Depression is commonly presented to GPs who feel that the diagnosis often involves the separation of a normal reaction to environment and true illness. For those patients living in socio-economically deprived environments, the problems, and therefore the depression, are seen to be insoluble. This has an important implication for the construction of educational interventions around improving the recognition and treatment of depression in primary care: some doctors may be reluctant to recognize and respond to such patients in depth because of the much wider structural and social factors that we have suggested in this paper. That it is the doctors working with deprived populations who express these views, means that the 'Inverse care law' [Tudor Hart J. The inverse care Law. Lancet 1971; 1(7696): 405-412] operates in the management of depression.",

Effective judgment is required to decide which patients would benefit most from decompression of the urinary tract. The objective of our study was to assess survival and complication rates post-percutaneous nephrostomy (PCN) in patients with ureteric obstruction due to advanced pelvic malignancy. A detailed retrospective case review of all patients who underwent PCN for ureteric obstruction due to pelvic malignancy in one calendar year was conducted to assess indication, survival time, length of stay post-procedure and complications. Thirty-six nephrostomies were performed on 22 patients with prostate cancer being the commonest primary (55 %). Renal failure was the commonest mode of presentation (56 %). Eight patients (36 %) presented without a prior diagnosis of cancer. All PCNs except one were initially technically successful, and 56 % of renal units were able to be antegradely stented and rendered free of nephrostomy. Median survival post-nephrostomy was 78 days (range 4-1,137), with the subset of bladder cancer patients having the poorest survival. Dislodgement of the nephrostomy tube was the most common troublesome complication which led to the greatest morbidity, sometimes requiring repeat nephrostomy insertion. Patients stayed for a median of 23 (range 3-89) days in hospital, which amounted to 29 % of their remaining lifetime spent in hospital.\nQuestion: Percutaneous nephrostomy for ureteric obstruction due to advanced pelvic malignancy: have we got the balance right?",

There is concern about the ability of a systemic RV to support the additional volume load of pregnancy, and previous studies have reported deterioration in RV function following pregnancy. However, conditions with a systemic RV are also associated with progressive RV dysfunction over time. To date, no study has examined whether the deterioration associated with pregnancy is due to the physiological changes of pregnancy itself, or is part of the known deterioration that occurs with time in these patients. Women who had undergone pregnancy under the care of the Adult Congenital Heart Disease Unit at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital were retrospectively identified and matched to separate male and nulliparous female controls. Functional status (New York Health Association [NYHA]), RV function, and systemic atrioventricular valve regurgitation were recorded for each group at baseline, postpregnancy (or at 1 year for control groups) and at latest follow-up. Eighteen women had 31 pregnancies (range 1-4) resulting in 32 live births. There were no maternal but one neonatal death. At baseline, there was no significant difference in NYHA class or RV function between pregnancy and control groups. In postpregnancy, there was a significant deterioration in the pregnant group alone for both NYHA class (P = 0.004) and RV function (P = 0.02).

Using Cox regression that adjusted for standard patient-level disease and demographic factors and neighborhood-level economic factors, we found a positive association between the distance patients traveled from their residence to the treatment center and survival.

Quality of surgery were analyzed by calculating the inverse relationship between volume and outcome (complication rate). To achieve complication rates (permanent unilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis and hypocalcemia) of<1 % (primary surgery) or<3 % (redo surgery) the minimum number of thyroid operations of lower level of experience (e. g. benign nodular goiter) per year was n=30. The minimum number of operations with higher level of experience was significantly lower (n=3-12) due to the higher level of experience of operating surgeons. In contrast to the rates of postoperative hypocalcemia the rates of postoperative recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis was clearly related to the number of thyroid operations performed.\nQuestion: Thyroid surgery: generalist or specialist?",
    "expected_answer": "The high number of thyroid operations in Germany with about 20 % of operations of high level experience are requiring surgical curricula and hospital structures that offer as well generalists as specialists to treat the broad spectrum of thyroid diseases accordingly. To lower the complication rate especially of difficult thyroid operations the level of specialization in Germany have to be increased.",

We identified all singleton fetuses with known sex undergoing genetic sonography at 17 weeks' to 21 weeks 6 days' gestation in a single perinatal center from January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2003. Markers studied were biparietal diameter/femur length, transcerebellar diameter, ear length, echogenic bowel, femur length, humerus length, absent middle fifth phalanx, nuchal fold, renal pelvis dilatation, echogenic cardiac focus, and choroid plexus cysts. Additional information extracted from the prospectively ascertained database included maternal age, referral indications, and chromosomal analyses. Multiple gestations and fetuses with structural or chromosomal abnormalities were excluded. The study received exempt review status by the Institutional Review Board. Dichotomous variables were compared by the chi(2) or Fisher exact test; continuous variables were compared by the unpaired t test. In total, 4057 eligible fetuses, 2103 male and 1954 female, were examined at 18.9 +/- 0.9 weeks (mean +/- SD). Referral indications included maternal age of 35 years or older (n = 2983), abnormal second-trimester serum screen results (n = 610), soft marker on sonography (n = 583), prior aneuploid offspring (n = 24), and other (n = 125). More than 1 referral indication was possible for a given fetus. Overall, male fetuses exhibited echogenic fetal bowel (odds ratio, 1.76; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.14-2.72; P = .009) and renal pelvis dilatation (odds ratio, 2.00; 95% CI, 1.30-3.09; P = .001) significantly more often than female fetuses. However, when fetuses were evaluated for single isolated markers, only male predominance of renal pelvis dilatation persisted (odds ratio, 2.32; 95% CI, 1.32-4.09; P = .003). No markers had increased frequency in female offspring.\nQuestion: Does the frequency of soft sonographic aneuploidy markers vary by fetal sex?",
    "expected_answer": "Male fetuses exhibit a significantly increased frequency of renal pelvis dilatation compared with female fetuses. Sex-specific adjustment of sonographically derived aneuploidy risk does not appear to be indicated. However, a larger series of fetuses with trisomy 21 and pyelectasis is required to assess sex-specific risk adjustment for this marker.",

A randomized trial of metformin (1500 mg daily) and placebo in 24 anovulatory women was undertaken for 3 months. Assessments of changes in hormone levels and insulin sensitivity were carried out. Abnormal hormonal values were defined by levels exceeding the range in normal ovulatory controls. Anovulatory women had normal androgen levels and luteinizing hormone but had higher serum insulin and lower insulin sensitivity compared with controls. Over 3 months, there were 16 ovulatory cycles with metformin and only 4 with placebo ( P<.05).

    "prompt": "Answer the question based on the following context: Standard electrophysiologic techniques generally allow discrimination among mechanisms of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the response of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia to atrial and ventricular overdrive pacing can help determine the tachycardia mechanism. Fifty-three patients with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia were studied. Twenty-two patients had the typical form of atrioventricular (AV) junctional (nodal) reentry, 18 patients had orthodromic AV reentrant tachycardia, 10 patients had atrial tachycardia, and 3 patients had the atypical form of AV nodal reentrant tachycardia. After paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia was induced, 15-beat trains were introduced in the high right atrium and right ventricular apex sequentially with cycle lengths beginning 10 msec shorter than the spontaneous tachycardia cycle length. The pacing cycle length was shortened in successive trains until a cycle of 200 msec was reached or until tachycardia was terminated. Several responses of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia to overdrive pacing were useful in distinguishing atrial tachycardia from other mechanisms of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. During decremental atrial overdrive pacing, the curve relating the pacing cycle length to the VA interval on the first beat following the cessation of atrial pacing was flat or upsloping in patients with AV junctional reentry or AV reentrant tachycardia, but variable in patients with atrial tachycardia. AV reentry and AV junctional reentry could always be terminated by overdrive ventricular pacing whereas atrial tachycardia was terminated in only one of ten patients (P<0.001). The curve relating the ventricular pacing cycle length to the VA interval on the first postpacing beat was flat or upsloping in patients with AV junctional reentry and AV reentry, but variable in patients with atrial tachycardia. The typical form of AV junctional reentry could occasionally be distinguished from other forms of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia by the shortening of the AH interval following tachycardia termination during constant rate atrial pacing.\nQuestion: The response of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia to overdrive atrial and ventricular pacing: can it help determine the tachycardia mechanism?",
    "expected_answer": "Atrial and ventricular overdrive pacing can rapidly and reliably distinguish atrial tachycardia from other mechanisms of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia and occasionally assist in the diagnosis of other tachycardia mechanisms. In particular, the ability to exclude atrial tachycardia as a potential mechanism for paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia has important implications for the use of catheter ablation techniques to cure paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia.",

Patients were assigned to receive mepolizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against interleukin-5, which was administered as either a 75-mg intravenous dose or a 100-mg subcutaneous dose or placebo every 4 weeks for 32 weeks. The primary outcome was the rate of exacerbations. Other outcomes included the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and scores on the St. George\u2019s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) and the 5-item Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-5).\nResults:\nThe rate of exacerbations was reduced by 47% (95% confidence interval [CI], 29 to 61) among patients receiving intravenous mepolizumab and by 53% (95% CI, 37 to 65) among those receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab, as compared with those receiving placebo (p<0.001 for both comparisons). Exacerbations necessitating an emergency department visit or hospitalization were reduced by 32% in the group receiving intravenous mepolizumab and by 61% in the group receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab. At week 32, the mean increase from baseline in FEV1 was 100 ml greater in patients receiving intravenous mepolizumab than in those receiving placebo (p=0.02) and 98 ml greater in patients receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab than in those receiving placebo (p=0.03). The improvement from baseline in the SGRQ score was 6.4 points and 7.0 points greater in the intravenous and subcutaneous mepolizumab groups, respectively than in the placebo group, and the improvement in the ACQ-5 score was 0.42 points and 0.44 points greater in the two mepolizumab groups, respectively than in the placebo group (p<0.001 for all comparisons).\nConclusions:\nMepolizumab administered either intravenously or subcutaneously significantly reduced asthma exacerbations and was associated with improvements in markers of asthma control.\nGiven the original research abstract above, which of the following would be true if the authors had inadvertently encountered a type 1 error?
