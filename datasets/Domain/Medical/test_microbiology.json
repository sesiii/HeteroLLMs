The past medical history is unobtainable due to a language barrier (the patient recently immigrated from abroad), but his wife says her husband had a motor vehicle accident when he was a teenager that required surgery. He is transferred to the ICU after a few hours in the ED because of dyspnea, cyanosis, and near-collapse. There are no signs of a meningeal infection. The Blood pressure was 70/30 mm Hg at the time of transfer. A chest X-ray at the time of admission showed interstitial infiltrates without homogeneous opacities. The initial laboratory results reveal metabolic acidosis, leukopenia with a count of 2,000/mm\u00b3, thrombocytopenia (15,000/mm\u00b3), and a coagulation profile suggestive of disseminated coagulation. A peripheral smear was performed and is shown below. Despite ventilatory support, administration of intravenous fluids, antibiotics, and vasopressor agents, the patient died the next day. A gram stain from an autopsy specimen of the lungs revealed gram-positive, lancet-shaped diplococci occurring singly or in chains. Which of the following organisms is most likely?
