    "predicted": "To determine the probability of drawing a heart or a king from a standard deck of 52 cards, we can use the principle of Inclusion-Exclusion. This method helps avoid double-counting any cards that fall into both categories.\n\nFirst, let's identify the number of hearts in the deck:\n- There are 13 hearts in a standard deck (one for each suit: hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades).\n\nNext, let's count the number of kings. There are also 4 kings in the deck (one king per suit: hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades).\n\nHowever, we need to be careful not to double-count the cards that are both hearts and kings. The King of Hearts is included in both the \"hearts\" category and the \"kings\" category.\n\nThe number of cards that are either a heart or a king can be calculated as follows:\n- Total number of hearts: 13\n- Total number of kings: 4\n\nSince the King of Hearts (which is also a heart) should not be counted twice, we subtract this overlap from our sum:\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of hearts or kings} = (\\text{Hearts}) + (\\text{kings}) - (\\text{King of Hearts}) \\]\n\\[ \\text{Number of hearts or kings} = 13 + 4 - 1 = 16 \\]\n\nNow, to find the probability, we take the number of favorable outcomes (hearts or kings) and divide it by the total number of possible outcomes in a deck:\n\n\\[ P(\\text{Heart or King}) = \\frac{\\text{Number of hearts or kings}}{\\text{Total number of cards}} \\]\n\\[ P(\\text{Heart or King}) = \\frac{16}{52} \\]\n\nSimplifying the fraction:\n- The greatest common divisor of 16 and 52 is 4.\n\n\\[ P(\\text{Heart or King}) = \\frac{16 \\div 4}{52 \\div 4} = \\frac{4}{13} \\]\n\nTherefore, the probability of drawing a heart or a king from a standard deck of 52 cards is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\frac{4}{13}} \\]",
