    "predicted": "To determine the number of ways to distribute 5 identical candies to 3 children such that each child receives at least one candy, we can use a combinatorial approach. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Ensure Each Child Gets at Least One Candy:**\n   Since each child must receive at least one candy, we first give one candy to each child. This means we have already distributed 3 candies (one to each of the three children). Now, we need to distribute the remaining \\(5 - 3 = 2\\) candies among the 3 children.\n\n2. **Distribute the Remaining Candies:**\n   We now need to find the number of ways to distribute 2 identical candies to 3 children where any child can receive zero or more candies. This is a classic \"stars and bars\" problem in combinatorics, where we are trying to count the non-negative integer solutions to the equation:\n   \\[\n   x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 2\n   \\]\n   Here, \\(x_1\\), \\(x_2\\), and \\(x_3\\) represent the number of additional candies each child receives.
