To simplify further, let's factor out a 7 from the expression:\n\n(7k)^2 + 1 = 7(k^2 + 1/7)\n\nSince we are looking for divisibility by 7, we can see that (k^2 + 1/7) is not divisible by 7 for any integer value of k.\n\nNow, let's try to find values of n such that n^2 + 1 is congruent to -1 modulo 7.

    "predicted": "To prove that there are infinitely many primes of the form $4k+3$, we can use mathematical induction and the concept of Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions.\n\n**Assumption 1:** The statement is true for some non-negative integer $n$. In other words, if we have a number of the form $4k+3$ that has not been proven to be prime, then there must exist another number of the same form which has already been shown to be composite.\n\n**Assumption 2:** Assume there are no primes of the form $4k+3$. This is our \"invariant\" assumption throughout the proof. We aim to show this leads to a contradiction, thus completing the induction step.\n\n**Induction Hypothesis:**\n\nFor some non-negative integer $n$, we assume that all numbers of the form $4k+3$ (where $1\\le k\\le n$) are composite, i.e., they have prime factors other than 2 and themselves. This means for any number $m = 4k + 3$, there exists a positive integer $p$ such that $p > \\sqrt{m}$ and $p|m$. We can use this to show the primality of numbers greater than $n+1$.\n\n**Induction Step:**\n\nConsider the next number in our sequence, which is of the form $4k + 3$, where $k = n+1$. By our induction hypothesis, all such numbers are composite. Therefore, there exists a prime factor $p > \\sqrt{4(n+1)+3} = \\sqrt{4n+7}$.\n\nNow consider the number $m = 4(n+2) + 3 = 4n + 11$. Using the induction hypothesis again, we can find a composite prime divisor of this number. Specifically, if there exists a prime factor $p > \\sqrt{4n + 7}$ dividing $m$, then it also divides $(4n + 7)p$.\n\nHowever, since $p > \\sqrt{4(n+1)+3} = \\sqrt{4n+7}$, we have that $\\frac{(4n+7)p}{4n+11} < 1$. This is a contradiction because the numerator and denominator are both greater than 1 for any positive integer n. Therefore, our assumption that all numbers of the form $4k+3$ are composite must be false.\n\n**Conclusion:** By mathematical induction, we have shown that there are indeed infinitely many primes of the form $4k+3$.",
