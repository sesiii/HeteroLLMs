    "predicted": "You're exploring the relationship between cat species and their coat colors.\n\nWhile it's true that all mammals are classified as such, and many of those mammals (like humans) have black coats, this doesn't directly imply that every cat is black. Cats belong to a different class or category within the mammalian kingdom called Felidae.\n\nIn fact, there are over 40 species of domestic cats (Felis catus), and they come in various coat colors and patterns, such as tabby, tortoiseshell, calico, and so on. These differences are due to genetic variations and environmental factors, not just the color of their fur.\n\nSo, even though some mammals have black coats, it's not a guarantee that every cat is black. Cats can be any shade of brown, gray, white, or any other color within the Felidae family.\n\nTo summarize: all cats are mammals, but being black is just one characteristic among many that define a specific feline species (Felis catus).",
