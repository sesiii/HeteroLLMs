This contradicts the assumption, so there are infinitely many such primes.",
    "predicted": "To prove that there are infinitely many primes of the form $4k+3$ for a non-negative integer $k$, we can use the following key steps:\n\n1.  We start by assuming the contrary, i.e., that every prime number greater than or equal to $4 \\times 100 = 400$ is of the form $4k + 3$. This means we are considering all primes $\\geq 400.$\n\n2.  Next, we consider the set $S$ of numbers in question (primes) and their corresponding indices $n$. Then, by definition, $n \\leq 399$.\n\n3.  Now, let's assume that there are only finitely many primes of the form $4k+3$, say there are $\\alpha <\\beta$ primes in this set. We can then write down an inequality based on our assumption: for all primes $p > \\max_{n\\leq399}\\left( 4n + 3\\right),$ we have that $p<400.$\n\n4.  Using the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, if a number is composite, it must have prime factors. If we take any such prime $p$ in our set and consider its minimal polynomial over $\\mathbb{Q}$, then this polynomial must be reducible with respect to some prime $q\\in S.$\n\n5.  This means that there exists an integer $m$ such that $$p^m=q\\left( x^{a_1}\\cdots x^{a_m} \\right),$$ where each coefficient of the polynomial is in $\\mathbb{Z}$ and $0\\leq a_i\\leq n.$\n\n6.  Now, consider the polynomials $x^{2k+1},\\quad x^2,\\quad x,$ and $1$ modulo $(p-1)$. Since all these polynomials are reducible (as they can be factored in $\\mathbb{Z}/p-1$), we have that there exist elements $u,v,w,x_1,\\dots, x_k\\in S$, such that $$x^{2k+1}\\equiv x^w \\pmod{(p-1)},\\quad x^2\\equiv u \\pmod{(p-1)},\\quad x\\equiv v\\ p,$$ and $1\\equiv w.$\n\n7.  Therefore, the polynomial $(x^{2k+1}-x)(x^2-xv)(x-w)$ is divisible by $p$, so $$0=(x-v)(x-w)(x^{2k+1}-x)\\equiv x^2 \\pmod{(p-1)}.$$ \n\n8.  If we substitute the values for $x$ and simplify, then we obtain:$$\\begin{align*}\n0&amp;\\equiv p(x^2-xv)(x-v)x^{2k+1} \\\\\n\\Leftrightarrow (x^k)^2-(vx+1)(x+v)x^k+x^{k+2}&=p0\\\\\n\\Leftrightarrow x^{2k}(v-1)-(vx+1)(x+v)x^k&=p0.\n\\end{align*}$$\n\n9.  Since we know that $p<400$, then all the coefficients of this polynomial are in $\\mathbb{Z}$, and $0\\leq v,k\\leq n.$ \n\n10. As a result, since each $x^k$ is an integer, we have that $$x^{2k}=(vx+1)(x+v)x^k.$$ \n\n11. Next, since the coefficients of this polynomial are all in $\\mathbb{Z}$, we can conclude that: $$(\\text{odd})$$\n\n12. Now, let's assume that $x$ is a prime number. Then $x^{2k+1}=p$, and as previously proven, there exist elements $u,v,w,x_1,\\dots, x_k\\in S$, such that $$x^{2k+1}\\equiv x^w \\pmod{(p-1)},$$\n\n13.  Now consider the equation $(x-v)(x-w)\\mid (x^{2k+1}-x)$.\n\n14.  Since $v,w,x_1,\\dots, x_k\\in S$ and $\\{v,w,x_1,\\dots, x_k\\}$ is pairwise coprime, we can find $i,j\\in\\mathbb{Z}^+$ such that $w=x_i-v$, $u=v+w$, and $x_j=w+x_i$. \n\n15.  This means that the equation $(x-w)(x-v)\\mid (x^{2k+1}-x)$ is equivalent to $$0=0.$$ \n\n16. Therefore, this implies that $x$ is a prime number.\n\n17. Finally, we can use this result along with Lagrange's Four-Square Theorem to prove that there are infinitely many primes of the form $4k+3.$\n\n18. By using Lagrange's Four-Square Theorem and considering all possible values of $n$, for each $n<399,$ we can find a prime number $p$ such that $$4n+p=400.$$",
