This is an integer because it can be factored into squares, and then subtracting 4.\n\n3. **Check divisibility by primes of the form \\(4k+3\\):**\n   Notice that:\n   \\[\n   N = (p_1 \\cdot p_2 \\cdots p_n)^2 - 4 = (p_1^2 + 2p_1 + 2)(p_2^2 + 2p_2 + 2) \\cdots (p_n^2 + 2p_n + 2)\n   \\]\n   Every prime \\(q\\) of the form \\(4k+3\\) divides each term in the product:\n   - If \\(q \\mid p_i^2 + 2p_i + 2\\), then since \\(p_i^2 + 2p_i + 2 \\equiv (q-1)p_i^2 + 2(p_i+1) \\equiv 0\\) mod \\(q\\),\n     and thus \\(p_i^2 + 2p_i + 2 \\equiv p_i^2 + 2p_i \\equiv -4 \\mod q\\).\n   Therefore, for any prime \\(q\\) of the form \\(4k+3\\):\n   \\[\n   (q-1) | (p_1^2 + 2p_1 + 2) \\cdots (p_n^2 + 2p_n + 2)\n   \\]\n   Hence, \\(q\\) divides one of these factors completely.\n\n4. **Show that \\(N\\) is not divisible by any prime \\(p_i\\):**\n   The number \\(N = p_1^2 + p_2^2 + \\cdots + p_n^2 - 4\\) is clearly greater than zero, and hence it cannot be divisible by one of the primes in our list.

If there were only finitely many, then for large enough \\(N\\), it would imply that \\(N\\) is not divisible by any prime within our set, leading to a contradiction.
