However, this creates a contradiction because if S is not on one end, then T would also need to be on the other side of S (since Q is not on an end), which doesn't leave enough space for R to sit next to S without violating the rule that R cannot be next to S.\n- If P and Q are together in the middle, we still have a conflict because if R were to sit between them, it would mean S is also sitting at one of these two ends (as there's no way to place it on another end without breaking the rules).\n\nConsidering all the above points:\n\n1.
