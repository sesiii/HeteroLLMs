This algorithm will give us a pair of integers x' and y' such that:\n\n3x' + 5y' = 1\n\nSince we want to find values for x and y such that 3x + 5y = 11, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 4 (which is equivalent to adding 1 to -2 times a multiple of 3) to get:\n\n12x' + 20y' = 44\n\nNow, we need to find integers x' and y' such that this equation equals 44.

Then we can list them out as:\n\n$p_1 = 4k+3$, $p_2 = 4(k+1)+3$, $\\ldots$, $p_n = 4k+n+3$.\n\n**Step 2: Use the properties of prime numbers**\n\nWe know that if a number is composite, it can be written as a product of two smaller positive integers. Suppose that $p_1 \\cdot p_2 \\cdots p_n$ is also a prime number of the form $4k+3$. Then we have:\n\n$(p_1 \\cdot p_2) \\cdots (p_n) = 4k+3$\n\nSince each $p_i$ is of the form $4k+i$, we can write $(p_1 \\cdot p_2) \\cdots (p_n)$ as a product of numbers in the form $(2i)^j$, where $i=1,2,\\ldots,n$ and $j=1,2,\\ldots,k$. We know that all primes are of the form $4k+3$, so none of these terms can be of the form $4k+i$, as they would not have a factor of 2.\n\nHowever, since $(p_1 \\cdot p_2) \\cdots (p_n)$ is also of the form $4k+3$, we must have:\n\n$(2i)^j = p_i$\n\nfor all $i=1,2,\\ldots,n$ and $j=1,2,\\ldots,k$. This implies that each term $(2i)^j$ has a factor of 2, which is impossible since it would not be of the form $4k+i$. Therefore, our assumption that there are only finitely many primes of the form $4k+3$ must be false.\n\n**Step 3: Conclusion**\n\nBy showing that any number of the form $4k+3$ can be factored into smaller positive integers with no common factors (other than 1), we have proven that there exist infinitely many prime numbers of the form $4k+3$.",
