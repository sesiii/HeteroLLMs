This contradicts the assumption, so there are infinitely many such primes.",
    "predicted": "To prove that there are infinitely many primes of the form $4k+3$, we can use the following approach:\n\nStep 1: Assume that all primes of the form $4k+3$ are either prime or composite.\n\nLet's assume that every prime of the form $4k+3$ is either prime or composite. This means that for any prime number of this form, it must be either a prime itself (since primes are assumed to be prime) or can be expressed as a product of two integers ($p = ab$, where $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime).\n\nStep 2: If all primes of the form $4k+3$ are prime, then they cannot be composite.\n\nNow, we need to show that these assumptions lead to a contradiction. If every prime number of the form $4k+3$ is either prime or composite, and none of them can be expressed as a product of two integers (since if they could, it would mean they are not of the form $4k+3$, which contradicts our assumption that all primes of this form are prime), then we must find at least one prime number of this form. \n\nHowever, the only way for a number to be of the form $4k+3$ but not prime is if it can be expressed as $4k+1$. If such a number exists, we have found a prime that cannot be part of our assumed set (since all primes of the form $4k+3$ are assumed to be either prime or composite). Therefore, we should look for another prime of this form.\n\nHowever, this assumption does not lead us anywhere directly because it assumes that there is no other prime of this form. But what if there were two primes of the same form? This leads us back to a contradiction where we assume there are only two primes of the form $4k+3$.\n\nStep 3: Assume that there are fewer than infinitely many primes of the form $4k+3$. Then, by the Pigeonhole Principle, at least two prime numbers must share the same form $4k+3$.\n\nNow, let's assume that there are fewer than infinitely many primes of the form $4k+3$. This means we have a finite number of such primes. \n\nStep 4: Using Euclid's Lemma, all other numbers of this form can be expressed as a product of two prime numbers.\n\nBy Euclid's Lemma, any prime number that is not of the form $4k+3$ can be expressed as a product of two integers ($p = q \\cdot r$, where $q$ and $r$ are relatively prime). \n\nStep 5: Therefore, we have found primes of the form $4k+3$ that are not prime.\n\nNow, we need to show that these assumptions lead to a contradiction. We assumed that there were fewer than infinitely many primes of the form $4k+3$, and by Euclid's Lemma, this implies that all other numbers of this form can be expressed as a product of two integers ($p = q \\cdot r$). \n\nSince all such products are distinct (by Euclid's Lemma), we have found at least one prime number of the form $4k+3$. However, by our assumption, there should not be any primes of this form. This leads to a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, our initial assumptions must be false, and there are indeed infinitely many primes of the form $4k+3$.\n\nTo prove that they are all prime, we can use a simple argument:\n\nStep 6: We will show that it is impossible for any number of the form $4k+3$ to be divisible by other numbers except 1 and itself.\n\nConsider a number $n = 4k + 3$. Since $n \\equiv 0 \\mod 2$, we have $n = 2m + 1$ for some integer $m$.\n\nIf $n$ is not prime, then it can be written as a product of two integers ($n=pq$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime). Then $(pq) - n = pq - (2m + 3) = p(2m+1)$. Since $p \\mid (2m+1)$, we have $p \\mid 2m+1$. \n\nNow, $p < n$, so $(2m+1)/p > m+p$. Therefore, we have $(pq)/(p(m+p)) > 1/p$, which implies that $\\gcd(pq,p(m+p)) = p$.\n\nSince this is true for all $n$, our initial assumption that any number of the form $4k+3$ can be written as a product of two integers must be false. Therefore, it is indeed impossible for a number of the form $4k+3$ to be divisible by other numbers except 1 and itself.\n\nTherefore, all primes of the form $4k + 3$ are prime.",
