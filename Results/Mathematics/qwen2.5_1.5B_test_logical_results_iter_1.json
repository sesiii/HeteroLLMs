Therefore, House 1 must either be blue or green.\n2. Since we know House 2 is green:\n   - If House 1 were green, then that would mean all three houses (1, 2, and 3) cannot have the same color because House 2 is already green.\n   - We also need to consider the condition for House 3: not blue.\n\nLet's analyze this logically:\n\n- If House 1 were red:\n  - This would imply that only one house can be red (House 1), but we know there are three houses and each must have a different color. Hence, this scenario is not possible.\n  \nThus, the remaining possibilities for House 1 are blue or green.\n\n3. **Assigning colors based on the clues**:\n- If House 1 were blue:\n   - This would mean that House 2 (green) cannot be in the same row as House 1 and must therefore be assigned to one of the other houses.\n   - Considering House 3 is not blue, this could potentially fit all constraints.\n\nLet\u2019s test:\n\n- **Case:**\n  - House 1 = Blue\n  - House 2 = Green\n  - Then House 3 cannot be Blue (clue).\n  \nNow,\n- This leaves:\n  - Red for the third house since it is not restricted by any other constraint and fits all conditions.\n\nHence, we conclude:\n\n- **House 1**: Blue\n- **House 2**: Green\n- **House 3**: Red\n\nTherefore, the colors of the houses are:  \nHouse 1: Blue  \nHouse 2: Green  \nHouse 3: Red",
