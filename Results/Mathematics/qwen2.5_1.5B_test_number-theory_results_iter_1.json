Therefore:\n\n\\[ 7^{even} \\equiv 0 \\mod{4} \\]\n\nHowever, since we're specifically working with \\( 7^{10} \\) and not just powers of 2 (which would be the case for modulo 8), we can apply Fermat's Little Theorem in a more direct manner. This theorem states that if p is a prime number and a is any integer such that p divides neither a nor \\( a - 1 \\):\n\n\\[ a^{(p-1)} \\equiv 1 \\mod{p} \\]\n\nFor our problem, let \\( a = 7 \\) and \\( p = 4 \\).
