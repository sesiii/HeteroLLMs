Here, n = 10 (total items in the box) and k = 2 (items to be selected).\n\nSo, the total ways to select two items out of 10 is \\(C(10, 2) = \\frac{10!}{2!(10-2)!} = \\frac{10 \\times 9}{2 \\times 1} = 45\\).\n\nNext, we need to find the number of favorable outcomes (selecting two non-defective items).
