All cats are mammals.\n2. Some mammals are black.\n3. Since cats are mammals, and all mammals can be black, it follows that cats must also be black.\n\nThis is an example of a syllogism, a form of logical argument that uses deductive reasoning to arrive at a conclusion based on two or more premises.\n\nSo, in this case, the conclusion that some cats are black logically follows from the given premises.",
