    "predicted": "To solve the problem of distributing 5 identical candies to 3 children such that each child receives at least one candy, we can use a combinatorial method. Here's a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Ensure Each Child Gets at Least One Candy:**\n   Since each child must receive at least one candy, we first give 1 candy to each of the 3 children. This uses up 3 candies, leaving us with \\(5 - 3 = 2\\) candies to distribute freely among the 3 children.\n\n2. **Distribute the Remaining Candies:**\n   Now, we need to find the number of ways to distribute 2 identical candies to 3 children. This is a classic \"stars and bars\" problem in combinatorics. The formula for distributing \\(n\\) identical items into \\(k\\) distinct groups is given by \\(\\binom{n+k-1}{k-1}\\).\n\n   Here, \\(n = 2\\) (the remaining candies) and \\(k = 3\\) (the children). So we need to find the number of ways to distribute 2 candies among 3 children:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{2+3-1}{3-1} = \\binom{4}{2}\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Calculate the Binomial Coefficient:**\n   The binomial coefficient \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\) is calculated as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \\frac{4!}{2!2!} = \\frac{4 \\times 3 \\times 2!}{2! \\times 2 \\times 1} = \\frac{4 \\times 3}{2 \\times 1} = \\frac{12}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of ways to distribute 5 identical candies to 3 children such that each child receives at least one candy is \\(\\boxed{6}\\).",
