    "predicted": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of \"stars and bars\" or \"balls and urns.\" We have 5 identical candies (represented by stars) that need to be distributed among 3 children. Each child must receive at least one candy.\n\nFirst, let's give each child exactly one candy. This leaves us with:\n\n* 2 candies remaining\n* 1 child without a candy\n\nNow, we can distribute the remaining 2 candies using \"stars and bars\" method. We have 2 stars (representing the 2 candies) and 2 bars (representing the separation between the children). The number of ways to distribute these 2 stars among 2 children is given by the binomial coefficient:\n\n* (2+2)! / (2! * 2!) = 6\n\nSo, there are 6 ways to give each child exactly one candy.\n\nHowever, we need to exclude the cases where a child receives no candies. This means that two children will receive only one candy each, and the remaining child will receive zero candies. We can calculate this as:\n\n* (2+1)! / (1! * 2!) = 6 ways\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 12 ways to distribute the 5 identical candies among the 3 children, with each child receiving at least one candy.\n\nHowever, we need to consider that the order in which the candies are given doesn't matter. Since the children are distinct (i.e., they have names), we can arrange them in different orders. To account for this, we multiply by the number of ways to arrange 3 distinct objects:\n\n* 12 * 3! = 72\n\nSo, there are a total of 72 ways to distribute the 5 identical candies among the 3 children, with each child receiving at least one candy.",
