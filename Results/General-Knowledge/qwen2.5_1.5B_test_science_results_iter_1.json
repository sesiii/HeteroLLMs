    "expected": "Argon",
    "predicted": "The gas commonly used in electric light bulbs to prevent the filament from oxidizing and burning out is an inert gas, which typically includes argon (Ar) or nitrogen (N2). These gases provide a protective environment for the metal filament inside the bulb.\n\nIn most applications, either argon or a combination of nitrogen and argon is used as the primary fill. Argon offers better protection against oxidation compared to pure nitrogen because it forms a thin layer around the filament that shields it from atmospheric oxygen. The exact composition can vary depending on specific requirements for different types of bulbs (e.g., incandescent, halogen, or fluorescent).\n\nFor example:\n- In incandescent light bulbs, argon is commonly used.\n- In low-pressure sodium vapor lamps and some types of mercury lamps, nitrogen is often combined with argon.\n\nThe purpose of using these inert gases in electric light bulbs is to create an environment where the metal filament can operate without being corroded by atmospheric oxygen.",

    "predicted": "The primary source of energy driving the Earth\u2019s climate system is the Sun.\n\nThe Sun provides approximately 95% of the energy that heats our planet. This energy travels through space as electromagnetic radiation and is absorbed by the Earth\u2019s surface, oceans, and atmosphere, heating them up. The absorbed heat then radiates back into space. \n\nHowever, about 2% of the solar energy received at the top of the atmosphere is reflected back to space due to the greenhouse effect in the atmosphere (mainly carbon dioxide), which warms the upper atmosphere and shifts the Earth\u2019s atmospheric circulation.\n\nThe remaining 3% goes into warming the oceans, ice sheets, and snow cover. The ocean absorbs almost all of this heat but also releases it slowly over time as part of its natural cycles like the Great Ocean Conveyor Belt (also known as the Global Thermohaline Circulation).\n\nTherefore, while the Sun provides around 95-98% of Earth\u2019s energy for climate warming and weather patterns, there are other factors that contribute to a significant portion of it.",

    "predicted": "The answer you're looking for is Carbon.\n\nCarbon is indeed crucial to the existence of life on Earth because it's an essential part of many compounds that are fundamental to biology. Here's why:\n\n1. **DNA and RNA**: These molecules are made primarily from four different types of nucleotides, each with a nitrogenous base (adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine for DNA; uracil for RNA). The sugar in these compounds is deoxyribose (for DNA) or ribose (for RNA), which are derived from glucose. Glucose has carbon as one of its atoms.\n\n2. **ATP**: Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is the energy currency used by living organisms, and it contains a small part of a sugar molecule, inositol.\n\n3. The structure itself:\n\n   - Amino acids, which are building blocks for proteins.\n   - Nucleotides, forming nucleic acids such as DNA and RNA.\n   - Many enzymes (proteins) that catalyze biochemical reactions require amino groups or other carbon-containing functional groups.\n\n4. **Atomic Number**: The atomic number of Carbon is 6. This means it has six protons in its nucleus and generally attracts a total of 6 electrons.",

    "expected": "A kilonova is a transient astronomical event caused by the collision of two neutron stars or a neutron star and a black hole, producing heavy elements and a burst of electromagnetic radiation.",
    "predicted": "A \"kilonova\" is a type of explosion that occurs when a massive star, possibly over 10 times the mass of our Sun, collapses and releases energy equivalent to a supernova. This phenomenon results from extremely heavy elements being produced in the core-collapse of this star.\n\nThe term \"kilonova\" was coined by theoretical astrophysicists after observing an unusual event: a neutron star merger that was mistaken for a kilonova due to its similarities with a nova, but turned out to be more powerful. This event occurred on October 17, 2019, involving two neutron stars orbiting each other very closely.\n\nThe most significant astronomical event associated with this type of explosion is the gravitational wave signal GW170817 observed by LIGO and Virgo in 2017, which was an indirect detection of a kilonova from neutron star mergers. The discovery led to the observation of electromagnetic counterparts using optical telescopes like Hubble Space Telescope. This event provided evidence for the merger of two neutron stars, releasing about as much energy as a supernova explosion but on a much smaller scale and with more compact objects involved.\n\nThe k-nova's importance lies in its potential role as a key to understanding the early universe by providing insights into the production of heavier elements such as gold, platinum, and other radioactive isotopes through neutron capture reactions. It also suggests that neutron star mergers may be common sources for gamma-ray bursts and gravitational waves, thus offering new pathways for detecting black holes in our galaxy.\n\nIn summary:\n- A kilonova is a supernova-like explosion from the collapse of an extremely massive star.\n- The most significant astronomical event associated with this type of explosion was the observation of GW170817 through LIGO-Virgo's gravitational wave detection, which then led to the discovery that it was actually a neutron star merger producing a kilonova.",
