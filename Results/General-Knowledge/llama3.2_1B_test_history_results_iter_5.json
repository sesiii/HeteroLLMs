    "expected": "It led to Mahatma Gandhi calling off the Non-Cooperation Movement in1922 due to violent clashes.",
    "predicted": "The Chauri Chaura incident was a significant event in India's freedom struggle that took place on November 29, 1922. It was a confrontation between the Indian National Congress and the British colonial authorities in the town of Chauri Chaura, located in the state of Bengal.\n\nThe incident began when Mahatma Gandhi, who was leading a march from Calcutta to Darjeeling, arrived at Chauri Chaura railway station to attend to a dispute over tickets. However, instead of meeting with local leaders and officials, he was met by Inspector N. K. Sinha, who had been instructed to arrest Gandhi due to his involvement in anti-colonial activities.\n\nGandhi, being uncooperative and unwilling to leave the train, refused to be arrested. He demanded that the British authorities recognize the Indian National Congress as a legitimate governing body and grant him freedom of speech and assembly. However, Sinha and other local officials were determined to arrest Gandhi.\n\nThe situation escalated into violence when Gandhi, along with several members of his party, including M.K. Vidyasagar and Ananda Chakrabarti, refused to be arrested despite repeated warnings. The police used batons and clubs to subdue the protesters, causing injuries and property damage.\n\nThe incident was seen as a major setback for the Indian National Congress's efforts to challenge British rule. Gandhi, who had been under house arrest since 1917 due to his involvement in the Satyagraha movement, emerged from hiding to confront the police. However, he was again arrested and imprisoned for several days.\n\nThe Chauri Chaura incident marked a turning point in the Indian National Congress's struggle against British rule. It highlighted the growing tensions between the colonial authorities and the Indian people, and it underscored the need for more radical actions to challenge British authority.\n\nGandhi himself wrote an open letter to the British government, condemning their treatment of him and urging them to respect his rights as a citizen. The incident also sparked widespread outrage in India and abroad, leading to increased pressure on the British government to grant Indian freedom from colonial rule.\n\nIn summary, the Chauri Chaura incident was a significant event in India's freedom struggle because it marked a major escalation of tensions between the Indian National Congress and the British colonial authorities. It highlighted the growing resistance of Indians to British rule and underscored the need for more radical actions to challenge colonial authority.",
