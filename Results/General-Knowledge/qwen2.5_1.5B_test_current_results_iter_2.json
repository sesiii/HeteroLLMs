    "expected": "The Sun",
    "predicted": "The primary source of energy driving Earth's climate system comes from the Sun.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. **Energy from the Sun**: The Sun emits electromagnetic radiation, including visible light and ultraviolet (UV) rays. This radiation is what we receive on Earth as sunlight.\n\n2. **Absorption by Atmosphere**: Part of this energy is absorbed in Earth\u2019s atmosphere, oceans, land surfaces, and living systems like plants.\n\n3. **Heat Transfer**: When heat is trapped near the surface by greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and water vapor, it warms the air close to the ground. This warming process continues upwards until we reach a layer where the air has cooled to 56.7\u00b0F (14\u00b0C), called the Earth's troposphere.\n\n4. **Heat Distribution**: The warmed air rises into the atmosphere and carries more heat aloft, which then falls down again at night as cooler air sinks back to lower altitudes. This circulation of warm and cool air is what drives most weather patterns on a day-to-day basis.\n\n5. **Long-term Cycles**: On longer time scales, such as 100 years or so, Earth's climate also involves cycles involving the amount of ice that exists in glaciers. The Sun's energy also affects these processes by regulating how much snow falls and evaporates seasonally.\n\nSo, while stars are generally thought to be primary sources of energy for other planets (such as Jupiter), the Sun provides the driving force for Earth\u2019s climate system through its continuous emission and the subsequent warming effects on our planet.",

This means we need to find 90% (since 100% + 10% = 100%) of the discounted price.\n\n\\[ \\text{Final Price} = (\\text{Discounted Price}) \\times \\frac{90}{100} \\]\n\nLet's perform these calculations:\n\n### Calculation for Discounted Price:\n\\[ \\$50 \\times 0.80 = \\$40 \\]\n\n### Calculation for Final Price:\n\\[ \\$40 \\times 0.90 = \\$36 \\]\n\nSo, the final price after applying the discount and adding the tax is $36.\n\nTo confirm this with Python code:\n```python\n# Original price of the item\r\noriginal_price = 50\r\n\r\n# Calculate discounted price (20% off)\r\ndiscounted_price = original_price * (1 - 0.20)\r\n\r\n# Calculate final price after adding 10% tax on the discounted price\r\nfinal_price = discounted_price * (1 + 0.10)\r\n\r\nprint(final_price)\n```\n```output\n36.0\n```\nThe final price of the item, after applying a 20% discount followed by an additional 10% tax, is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{36}\n\\]",

    "predicted": "In scenarios where an autonomous vehicle encounters a potential collision with either passengers or pedestrians, the primary principle is to prioritize the safety of all individuals involved. This involves making decisions that balance protection for humans and prioritizing passenger safety without sacrificing pedestrian safety entirely.\n\nHere are key factors and considerations:\n\n1. **Speed Reduction**: If there's a danger imminent, it is usually best to slow down to ensure stopping time is available to avoid or mitigate harm if passengers get into the vehicle.\n\n2. **Pedestrian Safety First**: Pedestrians can often be protected less effectively than occupants inside a car due to their smaller size and reduced protective barriers. Therefore, under certain circumstances, passenger safety might take secondary precedence over pedestrians.\n\n3. **Legal Compliance & Regulations**: Autonomous vehicles operating in public roads need to comply with existing traffic laws and regulations. These guidelines are usually structured around protecting all road users equally or prioritizing the least capable or at higher risk category first (usually pedestrian).\n\n4. **Scenario Specificity**: The circumstances of a potential collision scenario significantly impact how one decides which should be prioritized over another. \n\n5. **Emergency Measures**: In scenarios where an unavoidable crash is imminent, emergency measures are generally in place to ensure maximum safety for all occupants and pedestrians.\n\nIn summary, while passengers have the right to protection when inside a vehicle, autonomous vehicles need to implement strategies that prioritize overall road safety.
