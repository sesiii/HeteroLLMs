    "expected": "It led to Mahatma Gandhi calling off the Non-Cooperation Movement in1922 due to violent clashes.",
    "predicted": "The Chauri Chaura incident was a significant event in India's freedom struggle, which took place on February 23-24, 1922. It occurred during the Non-Cooperation Movement led by Mahatma Gandhi against British rule.\n\nOn February 23, 1922, a group of students and workers from different parts of Bengal were arrested by the police for participating in a procession demanding the release of a hunger-striker who had died in prison. The incident was seen as an attempt to break the non-violent protests that Gandhi had been advocating.\n\nHowever, on February 24, things took a dramatic turn when several hundred students and workers gathered at Chauri Chaura (the village where the procession started) to protest against the arrest of their friends and colleagues who had died in prison. Despite warnings from the authorities not to gather there, the protesters assembled at Chauri Chaura.\n\nThe police arrived on the scene, but instead of arresting the protesters as they expected, they began to beat them mercilessly. The crowd was then dispersed, and many of the protesters were killed or injured. In total, 10 people lost their lives in this brutal crackdown.\n\nThis incident marked a turning point in Gandhi's movement. He was deeply disturbed by the violence that had broken out on his orders, but also felt that it was a necessary step to galvanize public opinion and pressure the British government into taking action against their rule. However, he realized too late that this violent approach could have serious consequences.\n\nThe Chauri Chaura incident is often cited as one of the first instances where Gandhi's methods were seen as ineffective in achieving his goals, leading to a re-evaluation of his strategy and tactics. It also highlighted the deep-seated tensions between India and Britain, which would continue to simmer until India gained independence in 1947.\n\nIn the aftermath of Chauri Chaura, Gandhi was forced to abandon the Non-Cooperation Movement, and he shifted his focus to non-violent civil disobedience and armed resistance. However, this marked a significant shift in Gandhi's approach, and it took several years for him to regain the trust and support of the Indian people.\n\nThe Chauri Chaura incident remains an important chapter in India's history, highlighting the complexities and challenges faced by the nation as it struggled for independence from British rule.",

    "predicted": "The primary objective of the Champaran Satyagraha of 1917 in Bihar, India was to prevent the forced cultivation of indigo, a cash crop, by the British colonial authorities. The satyagraha was led by Mahatma Gandhi, who is considered one of the most influential figures of the Indian independence movement.\n\nThe British had imposed the British Indigo Company's monopoly on the production and sale of indigo in 1861. To facilitate this, the company installed a large number of Indo-Greek laborers to work on their plantations in Champaran district (now Sitamarhi district) in Bihar.\n\nMahatma Gandhi, who was then working in South Africa, read about the plight of these laborers and decided to return to India to lead a campaign against the British. He began by organizing a group of Indian farmers and artisans, known as Mahasabhars, who were involved in the production and sale of indigo.\n\nGandhi's primary objective was not only to stop the forced cultivation of indigo but also to expose the injustice and exploitation of the Indo-Greek laborers and to raise awareness about the cause among the Indian people. He used non-violent means such as civil disobedience, boycotts, and peaceful protests to achieve his goal.\n\nThe Champaran Satyagraha began in January 1917 and lasted for nearly two months. Gandhi's campaign was supported by various Indian leaders, including Lala Lajpat Rai, Bal Gangadhar Tilak, and Gopal Krishna Gokhale, among others.\n\nThe satyagraha achieved its primary objective when the British government was forced to repeal the law that granted a monopoly on indigo production. The British also had to release all the laborers from their plantations, and many of them were able to return to their homes with dignity.\n\nThe Champaran Satyagraha marked an important turning point in India's struggle for independence from British colonial rule. It showcased Gandhi's commitment to non-violent resistance and his ability to inspire mass mobilization and social change.",
