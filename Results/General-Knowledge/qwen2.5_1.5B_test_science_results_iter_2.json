    "predicted": "The gas commonly used in electric light bulbs (incandescent lamps) to prevent the oxidation of the filament and extend its life is a mixture of nitrogen, argon, and helium gases at a partial pressure of about 0.45 atm. These noble gases help by acting as an inert atmosphere that prevents atmospheric contaminants from causing oxidation of the tungsten filament.\n\nThe bulb itself contains some mercury vapor, which allows for better control of color temperature, but it's not part of the primary protective gas mixture. The main components are usually nitrogen (78%), argon (21%), and helium (1%).\n\nThis process is known as cathodic protection through noble gases or \"argon sealing.\" It was first developed by British physicist William R. Ramsay in 1903.",

    "expected": "Diamond",
    "predicted": "The hardest naturally occurring substance known to exist on Earth is diamond. Specifically:\n\n1. **Structure**: Diamond is a form of carbon that forms in the Earth's mantle under extreme pressure and temperature conditions, much deeper than where humans live.\n\n2. **Properties**:\n   - It is composed entirely of carbon atoms arranged in a three-dimensional structure.\n   - Each carbon atom is covalently bonded to four others, forming strong bonds between them.\n   - This high degree of sp3 hybridization (where each carbon atom has an s-orbital and a p-orbital) results in diamond's extremely rigid structure.\n\n3. **Physical Properties**:\n   - It is almost unbreakable because its crystalline structure prevents the atoms from sliding past one another.\n   - At room temperature, it remains hard and sharp, even at temperatures that would melt other solids.\n   - This hardness makes diamonds suitable for cutting or carving materials.\n\n4. **Geological Formation**: Diamonds are found in kimberlite pipes in certain types of igneous rocks (lithic gneisses) in various continents where mantle-derived material has reached the surface through volcanic eruptions and then cooled rapidly, leading to crystal formation under high pressure and temperature conditions typical for diamonds.\n\n5. **Significance**: Despite their hardness, natural diamonds are relatively rare because they require specific geological conditions not easily recreated on Earth's surface or at lower depths. They were discovered by humans only after the development of sufficient heat treatments or synthetic methods to replicate these conditions in laboratories.\n\nDiamonds play important roles in industry (as gemstones and industrial abrasives), technology (for electronic components due to their high electrical conductivity and thermal properties), and even as a source for scientific research on planetary formation.",

This radiation drives several essential processes:\n\n   - It heats the atmosphere, oceans, land surfaces, and even space itself.\n   - It is absorbed by greenhouse gases like water vapor, carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and others to warm the surface.\n   - It also provides energy for ecosystems through photosynthesis.\n\n2. **Heat from Earth's Interior**: The heat that originates deep within the Earth flows primarily as thermal convection in the mantle and crust layers. This internal heat is produced by radioactive decay of elements like uranium, thorium, potassium, and others. \n\n- The heat from the Earth\u2019s interior then drives several processes:\n  - Mantle convection: This movement helps distribute heat around the planet.\n  - Plate tectonics: The movement of rock plates (which is influenced by thermal anomalies) leads to plate boundaries where earthquakes can occur.\n  - Subduction zones: As cooler, denser material sinks into the mantle from ocean floors and continental margins.\n\nBoth these processes\u2014solar radiation heating and internal heat distribution\u2014work together in an interconnected climate system.",

    "predicted": "A \"Kilonova\" is a type of stellar explosion that occurs when a very massive star explodes, but the most notable feature about it is its size. The name \"kilonova\" was coined to describe this phenomenon because it happens in a kilonewton force range (about 10^5 - 10^6 newtons) compared to what you would expect from a supernova.\n\nThe event associated with a kilonova that made significant astronomical headlines occurred on August 17, 2017, when two black holes collided in the galaxy NGC 4970. This collision produced a shockwave and released about as much energy as the entire Sun would emit over 500 million years. The gravitational waves from this event were detected by LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory) on September 14, 2015.\n\nA kilonova is also a type of explosion that occurs when two neutron stars collide. This was the primary source for the first ever detection of gravitational waves in February 2016, as well as the detection of heavy elements like gold and platinum from this cosmic event through the analysis of radio emissions and the afterglow visible by telescopes around Earth.",
