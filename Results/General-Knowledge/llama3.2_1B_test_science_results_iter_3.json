Argon is an inert gas that is naturally present in the air and has a low reactivity with the tungsten filaments used in incandescent bulbs. By filling the bulb with argon, it helps to prevent the filament from oxidizing and burning up, which can cause the bulb to malfunction or even lead to fires.",

Diamonds are made up of pure carbon, which is one of the hardest substances known due to its strong covalent bonds between atoms. The hardness of a mineral is typically measured using the Mohs hardness scale, which ranks minerals from 1 (softest) to 10 (hardest).\n\nDiamond's hardness is so great that it can scratch most other minerals and materials, including corundum (ruby and sapphire), quartz, and many metals. This is due to its unique crystal structure, in which carbon atoms are bonded together through strong covalent bonds.\n\nIt's worth noting that diamond is not the hardest naturally occurring substance when considering all types of rocks, including minerals like jade and topaz. However, it remains the hardest naturally occurring substance known on Earth, with a Mohs hardness rating of 10.",

Solar energy is the energy emitted by the sun, and it plays a crucial role in maintaining Earth's climate. The sun's energy heats the planet's surface, oceans, and atmosphere, driving the water cycle, weather patterns, and temperature fluctuations.\n\nAccording to NASA, about 90% of the sun's energy is absorbed by the Earth's surface, with the remaining 10% reflected back into space as infrared radiation. This process is known as the \"solar constant\" and it is the main driver of Earth's climate system.\n\nThe solar constant varies throughout the year due to the tilt of Earth's axis (about 23.5 degrees) and its orbit around the sun. However, on average, about 2/3 of the sun's energy is received by the planet during the summer months and 1/3 during the winter months.\n\nSolar radiation helps regulate Earth's temperature, influencing factors such as:\n\n* Global warming and cooling\n* Weather patterns (e.g., El Ni\u00f1o, La Ni\u00f1a)\n* Climate variability (e.g., Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation)\n\nThe other significant sources of energy for Earth's climate system include:\n\n* Geological heat from the interior of the planet\n* Tidal heating due to gravitational interactions with the moon and sun\n* Volcanic eruptions releasing greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide\n\nHowever, solar radiation remains the dominant source of energy driving Earth's climate system.",

    "predicted": "A Kilonova is an extremely powerful and rare type of supernova explosion, named after the kilo- (1000s) scale of its energy release. It's a unique astronomical phenomenon that has garnered significant attention in recent years.\n\nKilonovae are the result of the merger of two neutron stars or binary systems, which releases an enormous amount of energy in the form of gamma-ray and X-ray radiation. The explosion is so powerful that it can be seen from millions of light-years away, making kilonovae one of the brightest objects in the universe.\n\nThe most notable Kilonova event observed so far is SN 2013j, which occurred on April 7, 2013, about 2.5 billion light-years away from Earth. It was a merger between two neutron stars, which released an energy equivalent to approximately 1.8 trillion solar masses in the form of gamma-ray and X-ray radiation.\n\nKilonovae are significant for several reasons:\n\n1. **Detection challenges**: Kilonovae are challenging to detect due to their extremely short duration (typically milliseconds) and lack of visible signs, making them difficult to observe with current telescopes.\n2. **Energy release**: The energy released by kilonovae is enormous, equivalent to millions of suns' worth of energy, which can have a significant impact on the surrounding environment.\n3. **Impact on galaxy evolution**: Kilonovae can potentially influence the formation and evolution of galaxies, as they can create heavy elements through nuclear reactions in the merger process.\n\nKilonovae are an exciting area of research, with scientists continuing to study these rare events to better understand their nature, behavior, and potential impacts on the universe.",
