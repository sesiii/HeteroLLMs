The Amazon River is approximately 6,400 kilometers (3,972 miles) long, flowing through nine countries: Brazil, Peru, Colombia, Ecuador, Bolivia, Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname, and French Guiana.\n\n2. It rises in the Andes Mountains near Lake Titicaca on the border between Peru and Bolivia.\n\n3. The Amazon River is a crucial part of one of the world's largest tropical rainforests, covering an area larger than all the other rainforests combined.\n\n4. In 1906, it was named after the Amazon river dolphin, which was discovered in the lower reaches of the river by Captain John Cooke during an expedition to Brazil.\n\n5. The upper and middle parts of the Amazon River are relatively calm, but its lower reaches can become turbulent due to heavy rainfall or flooding from nearby rivers like the Orinoco.\n\n6. It is known for its diverse ecosystems, including numerous species of birds, fish, mammals, and plants that have adapted to living in a tropical rainforest environment.\n\n7. The Amazon River basin contains more than half of all freshwater flowing into the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nThe Amazon River plays a crucial role in shaping South American geography and ecology, being home to millions of different species, providing habitat for many indigenous peoples, and supporting significant ecological functions like carbon sequestration and water regulation.",
