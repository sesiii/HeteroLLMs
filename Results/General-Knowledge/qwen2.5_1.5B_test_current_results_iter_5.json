    "predicted": "Autonomous vehicles should prioritize the safety of pedestrians in a potential collision scenario.\n\nThis is based on the principle that pedestrians often have less time to react than drivers and are more likely to be hit due to their lower speed relative to vehicles. Additionally, pedestrian accidents can cause significant personal injury or death. The primary responsibility for safety falls upon the driver or vehicle's operator if it is a self-driving system.\n\nIn designing autonomous driving systems, manufacturers should ensure that these systems prioritize the best outcomes for both passengers and pedestrians in such scenarios. This could involve developing algorithms that automatically slow down or stop when close to pedestrians. However, this also requires thorough testing and validation of the technology under various conditions to ensure it performs as expected in all situations.\n\nSafety is paramount in autonomous vehicles, and prioritizing pedestrians' safety can significantly enhance public trust and support for these innovative technologies.",
