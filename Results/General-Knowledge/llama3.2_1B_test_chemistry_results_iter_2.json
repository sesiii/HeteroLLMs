    "prompt": "Explain why mercury is unique among metals, and provide its atomic number. (JEE Advanced level)",
    "expected": "Mercury is unique because it is the only metal that is liquid at room temperature; its atomic number is 80.",
    "predicted": "Mercury is a unique metal due to its distinct properties, which can be attributed to its electronic configuration.\n\nThe atomic number of mercury is 80. Its electron configuration is [Mercury] 1s\u00b22s\u00b22p\u20763s\u00b23p\u20764s\u00b24d\u00b9\u20705s\u00b25p\u20766s\u00b2. This configuration reveals why mercury exhibits some extraordinary properties.\n\nMercury has a relatively high ionization energy, which means it requires significant amounts of energy to remove an electron from its outermost shell. This property leads to several unique characteristics:\n\n1. **High melting and boiling points**: Due to the full outer energy level (5s\u00b2), mercury is highly resistant to melting and boiling. Its melting point is approximately 356\u00b0C, and boiling point is around -38\u00b0C.\n\n2. **Solubility in water**: Mercury forms a stable compound with water when it reacts with hydrogen ions, producing mercuric chloride (Hg\u2082Cl\u2082). This reaction is facilitated by the high ionization energy required to break the mercury-water bond.\n\n3. **High density and low viscosity**: Mercury has a relatively low atomic mass (200 g/mol) for its size. This results in an extremely high density of approximately 13.546 g/cm\u00b3, making it one of the densest elements.\n\n4. **Unique optical properties**: Mercury exhibits a characteristic phenomenon known as the \"Hg2O prism,\" where light passing through a mercury layer between two silver-coated glass plates splits into its component colors, creating a striking optical effect.\n\nThe combination of these unique properties contributes to mercury's distinct behavior and applications in various fields, including thermometry (due to its high melting point), laboratory equipment (as an inert electrode for electrochemical measurements), and industrial manufacturing processes.",
