    "predicted": "India gained independence from British rule in 1947. This was the end of nearly two centuries of British colonial rule and marked the beginning of India's journey towards democracy, secularism, and self-determination. The country underwent a significant transformation with its constitution being drafted by Nehru (which is often referred to as the \"Charter of Liberty\"), which served as a cornerstone for the nation's political development.\n\nIndia gained independence on August 15, 1947, following the partition of British India into two independent dominions: Pakistan in the west and India in the east. This event was part of a broader decolonization process across the world at that time, with many countries gaining their independence from European colonial powers.\n\nAfter gaining independence, India adopted its constitution on June 26, 1950, marking another significant milestone in India's history as it became the first country to adopt a constitution written by itself rather than being influenced externally. This period has been crucial not only for India but also for many other developing nations around the world seeking independence from colonial powers.",

    "expected": "It led to Mahatma Gandhi calling off the Non-Cooperation Movement in1922 due to violent clashes.",
    "predicted": "The Chauri Chaura incident (or more commonly spelled as Laxmamandir) was significant for several reasons during India's independence movement against British colonial rule:\n\n1. **Protests Against Police Brutality**: The event began on 20 February 1922 when Hindu-Muslim riots broke out in the area of Chauri Chaura, Uttar Pradesh, after a Sikh police constable was killed by two Muslim men who had allegedly insulted him.\n\n2. **Unrest and Violence**: It marked a turning point where communal violence escalated into widespread unrest across India. Thousands of people were injured or killed, leading to increased calls for an end to the British Raj.\n\n3. **Reinforcement of Indian National Movement**: The incident intensified the movement against British rule in India as it demonstrated the inability of the existing political parties and leaders to solve internal conflicts peacefully. It underscored the need for a more inclusive approach to resolving communal tensions.\n\n4. **Shift in Leadership and Ideology**: The incident led to a shift in leadership within the Indian National Congress, where key figures like Bal Gangadhar Tilak were replaced by Dr. Satyapal who was more committed to non-violent methods of struggle.\n\n5. **Criticization of Gandhi\u2019s Approach**: While Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi initially condemned the violence and called for calm, his subsequent approach emphasized self-surrender as a path towards truth. The Chauri Chaura incident highlighted that his strategy of passive resistance was not enough to address communal unrest.\n\n6. **International Attention**: It garnered international attention and press coverage, particularly from Western countries which were already supporting India's independence movement against the British. This heightened support for India\u2019s freedom struggle.\n\n7. **Distrust in Political Parties**: The incident also led to widespread distrust in existing political parties and leaders, leading many Indians to question whether a secular government could provide justice to both Hindus and Muslims without resorting to violence.\n\nThe Chauri Chaura incident thus played a crucial role in the Indian independence movement by escalating communal tensions into open conflict that highlighted issues of governance and security more effectively than any other event. It marked a turning point where Indians began to question their leaders' approach towards resolving social conflicts within the country.",

A peasant movement against the British Government's decision to prohibit jute cultivation.\n2. Farmers faced harsh conditions due to crop failure and low prices paid by local mills for their produce.\n3. The British mill owners were demanding that the peasants abandon jute farming, leading to a widespread protest.\n\nLeading figures involved in this struggle included:\n\n1. Gandhi himself: An Indian lawyer who was instrumental in organizing non-violent movements against colonial rule.\n2. Gopal Krishna Ghai: A farmer and advocate for social justice.\n3. Sardar Kishenji: Another prominent figure from Champaran, known as a successful farmer.\n\nThis movement highlighted the need for reform and improvement of agricultural practices and economic conditions for small farmers in British-ruled India, influencing future movements and providing important lessons about non-violent struggle against colonial oppression.",
