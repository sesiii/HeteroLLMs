    "expected": "Argon",
    "predicted": "The gas commonly filled in electric bulbs, such as incandescent and halogen bulbs, to prevent filament oxidation is nitrogen. This is done because nitrogen is an inert gas that doesn't react with the tungsten filaments, which can cause them to oxidize and degrade over time, leading to a decrease in brightness and potentially even a safety hazard.\n\nBy filling the bulb with nitrogen, the oxygen present in air helps to prevent this oxidation reaction from occurring on the filament. This is especially important for incandescent bulbs, as they are more prone to filament degradation than halogen bulbs.\n\nIt's worth noting that other inert gases, such as argon or krypton, can also be used in some applications to provide similar protection against filament oxidation.",

    "predicted": "The hardest naturally occurring substance known on Earth is diamond. Diamond is made up of pure carbon and is formed when carbon is subjected to incredibly high temperatures and pressures deep within the Earth's mantle. This process, known as high-pressure high-temperature (HPHT) synthesis, creates diamond with a crystal structure that is nearly perfect, with a hardness of 10 on the Mohs scale.\n\nDiamond's exceptional hardness is due to its unique atomic structure, which consists of strong covalent bonds between carbon atoms. These bonds are extremely stable and resistant to scratching and wear, making diamond one of the most durable substances known.\n\nIn fact, diamond is so hard that it can scratch other materials, including graphite (which is softer than diamond), without causing significant damage. This is why diamond is often used in industrial applications where extreme hardness is required, such as in cutting tools, drill bits, and abrasives.",

The sun emits a vast amount of electromagnetic radiation, including visible light and ultraviolet (UV) rays, which is absorbed by the planet's surface and atmosphere.\n\nThis process occurs through several mechanisms:\n\n1. Solar radiation absorption: The Earth's atmosphere absorbs about 30% of the sun's radiation, while about 70% is reflected back to space.\n2. Heat transfer: The absorbed solar energy is transferred to the oceans, land surfaces, and atmospheric gases, causing them to warm and evaporate.\n3. Evaporation and precipitation: As water vapor rises into the atmosphere, it cools, condenses, and falls back to the Earth's surface as precipitation (rain, snow, etc.).\n\nThis cycle of solar radiation absorption, heating, and evaporation is essential for maintaining Earth's climate system, including temperature regulation, weather patterns, and the formation of clouds and precipitation.",

    "predicted": "A Kilonova is an extremely powerful, brief cosmic explosion that occurs when a massive star undergoes a catastrophic collapse. The term \"kilonova\" comes from the fact that this explosion can be as heavy as 10^43 kilograms, which is equivalent to about 100 million trillion tons of TNT.\n\nKilonovas are typically associated with the merger of two neutron stars or the implosion of a massive star after it has exhausted its fuel and collapses into an extremely dense object called a black hole. This process can occur when two neutron stars orbit each other, causing them to spiral inward and eventually merge, or when a massive star runs out of fuel and collapses into a black hole.\n\nThe resulting Kilonova explosion is incredibly powerful, releasing an enormous amount of energy in the form of gamma rays, X-rays, and neutrinos. This energy release can be detected by telescopes on Earth, allowing us to study the properties of these cataclysmic events.\n\nKilonovas are also associated with a range of observational signatures, including:\n\n1. Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs): Kilonovas often trigger GRBs, which are massive explosions that release an enormous amount of energy in gamma rays.\n2. Fast radio bursts (FRBs): Some Kilonova events have been linked to FRBs, brief, intense pulses of radio energy that are thought to be caused by the collapse of a neutron star or black hole.\n3. Gravitational waves: The merger of two neutron stars or other compact objects can generate gravitational waves, which can be detected by advanced telescopes such as LIGO and VIRGO.\n\nThe study of Kilonovas has provided valuable insights into the properties of massive stars, supermassive black holes, and the interplay between these celestial objects.",
