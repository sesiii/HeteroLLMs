His tenure marked one of the most complex periods in Indian history, witnessing the struggle for independence, the implementation of the Simla Declaration, and ultimately, the partition.\n\nFollowing Mountbatten\u2019s departure, Sir Stafford Cripps took over as the new Viceroy until India achieved full independence on August 15, 1947.",

It also involved a temporary suspension of civil disobedience in exchange for an agreement to end hostilities between India and Pakistan, which had been caused by the dispute over Kashmir. The pact lasted until September 30, 1934.\n\nThe Gandhi-Irwin Pact was significant because it demonstrated that both leaders were willing to compromise on issues that divided them, even if they could not bridge their differences completely. It also showed that India's national movement for independence from British rule had reached a point where dialogue and negotiation could be effective in achieving the desired change.",
