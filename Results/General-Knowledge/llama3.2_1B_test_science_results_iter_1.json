Diamonds are made up of pure carbon that has been subjected to incredibly high temperatures and pressures deep within the Earth's mantle over billions of years. This process, known as high-pressure high-temperature (HPHT) synthesis, allows diamonds to achieve a crystal structure that makes them extremely hard, with a Mohs hardness of 10.\n\nIn fact, diamond is so hard that it can scratch most other minerals and rocks without even applying significant pressure or force. This is why diamonds are often used in industrial cutting tools, such as saw blades and drill bits, due to their exceptional durability and resistance to wear.\n\nOther substances, like corundum (the mineral form of aluminum oxide) and topaz, also have very high hardness values, but diamond remains the hardest naturally occurring substance known on Earth.",

Solar radiation, or sunlight, is the main driver of Earth's climate system and plays a crucial role in regulating its temperature and atmospheric circulation patterns.\n\nSolar radiation is released by the sun as electromagnetic waves, primarily consisting of visible light and ultraviolet (UV) radiation. These wavelengths are absorbed by the Earth's surface and atmosphere, warming it up to a temperature of around 15\u00b0C (59\u00b0F).\n\nThe amount of solar energy that reaches Earth's surface varies with time due to the tilt of the Earth's axis and its elliptical orbit around the sun. The shorter days of winter and longer days of summer are more closely aligned with the Earth's tilt, resulting in less direct sunlight reaching the equatorial regions during these times.\n\nIn addition to solar radiation, other sources of energy also contribute to the climate system, including:\n\n1. Geothermal heat: Heat from the Earth's interior, generated by convection and mantle circulation.\n2. Ocean heat: Heat transferred through ocean currents and evaporation.\n3. Atmospheric gases: Greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, methane, and water vapor, which trap heat in the atmosphere.\n\nHowever, solar radiation remains the dominant energy source for Earth's climate system, accounting for about 90% of the energy input into the system.",

    "predicted": "A Kilonova is a spectacular and rare astronomical event observed in the sky, primarily visible from Earth. It's an extraordinary explosion that occurs when two neutron stars or black holes merge.\n\nThe term \"Kilonova\" was coined by American astrophysicist Steven Hawking in 1998. This event is thought to be caused by the merger of a massive star (with a mass at least 25 times that of the sun) and either a neutron star or a supermassive black hole.\n\nDuring this cataclysmic explosion, the merged object undergoes an enormous gravitational collapse, releasing an immense amount of energy in the form of high-energy particles. This radiation is observed as a bright, short-lived flash across the sky, often accompanied by a faint afterglow that can persist for several weeks or even months.\n\nThe key characteristics of a Kilonova event are:\n\n1. **Extreme explosion**: The energy released during a Kilonova is estimated to be around 10^43 Joules, which is about 500 times more powerful than the energy released by the entire universe in just 1 second.\n2. **High-energy particles**: The radiation emitted by a Kilonova includes high-energy protons, electrons, and gamma rays, which can travel millions of kilometers through space before interacting with the interstellar medium.\n3. **Bright optical afterglow**: The explosion also produces a bright, short-lived burst of light that can be observed from great distances.\n\nKilonovas are rare events because they require extremely massive objects to collide. These collisions occur when massive stars exhaust their fuel and collapse in on themselves, eventually triggering the merger of two neutron stars or black holes.\n\nThe observation of Kilonovas has provided valuable insights into the properties of these extreme astrophysical events and their role in shaping the universe.",
