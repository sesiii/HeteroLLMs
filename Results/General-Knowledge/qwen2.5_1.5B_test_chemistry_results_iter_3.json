    "expected": "Mercury is unique because it is the only metal that is liquid at room temperature; its atomic number is 80.",
    "predicted": "Mercury (Hg), also known as quicksilver, is indeed unique among metals for several reasons related to its chemical behavior and physical properties:\n\n1. **Density**: Mercury has the second highest density of all elements at 13.59 g/cm\u00b3, with a specific heat capacity of 0.14 J/g\u00b0C. This high density makes mercury very heavy compared to other metals.\n\n2. **Melting Point**: The melting point of mercury is extremely low at -38.83\u00b0C (-290.79\u00b0F), which is unique among the metals and often contributes to its use in certain applications such as temperature control systems.\n\n3. **Boiling Point**: Mercury has a boiling point around 618\u00b0C (1,143\u00b0F), making it not very reactive compared to other metals when exposed to air or water vapor at higher temperatures.\n\n4. **Reactivity with Water**: Unlike most metals that react vigorously with water to form hydrogen and metal hydroxides, mercury does not dissolve in water but forms a protective oxide film on the surface of its liquid phase.\n\n5. **Lack of Solid State**: Mercury is unique among metals because it exists almost exclusively as a liquid at room temperature (except for some very small amounts present in natural deposits). This is due to its low density and high boiling point, which prevents molecular packing into a solid state even when cooled sufficiently.\n\n6. **Thermal Expansion**: While most metals expand slightly on heating and contract slightly on cooling, mercury exhibits an extremely large expansion coefficient of about 158% per \u00b0C change in temperature.\n\n7. **Electromagnetic Properties**: Mercury has unusual properties involving electromagnetics, such as the ability to induce electric currents near its surface and the creation of a strong magnetic field around it when excited with electrical current.\n\nMercury's unique chemical behavior is due to several factors including its atomic structure and electronic configuration (it is an exception among elements in its group), which results in lower electron affinity compared to other metals. This explains why mercury does not form stable compounds like many metals do, leading to its relatively short half-life of about 20 years before turning into the radioactive metal thallium-201.\n\n### Atomic Number:\nThe atomic number of mercury (Hg) is **80**.",
