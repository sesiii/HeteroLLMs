Prior to becoming the Prime Minister, he had served as an independent politician, working with national leaders like Mohandas Gandhi and Lord Louis Mountbatten during the final days of British colonial rule.\n\nNehru's leadership was crucial in the transition process leading up to independence, including negotiations with various stakeholders, particularly the Indian National Congress. He played a pivotal role in India's early post-independence governance framework until his death on May 27, 1964.",

However, it also marked a turning point in the Indian independence movement, as Gandhi shifted his strategy from non-violent resistance to more pragmatic forms of protest and diplomacy.",
