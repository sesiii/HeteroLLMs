    "predicted": "The primary source of energy for Earth's climate system is the Sun, which provides about 390 watts per square meter (W/m\u00b2) of power to the entire planet on average every year. This constant input of energy from the Sun heats and warms the atmosphere, oceans, and land surfaces throughout the day.\n\nWhile the Sun supplies most of Earth's heat directly through solar radiation, it also indirectly affects climate by influencing weather patterns. For instance, changes in how much sunlight is absorbed or reflected (albedo) can impact global temperatures and precipitation patterns on a local scale. Additionally, while not directly contributing to the Earth's temperature, the presence of life plays an important role as it alters atmospheric composition and thus impacts energy absorption.\n\nSo, while the Sun primarily provides the heat that drives Earth's climate system through its direct radiation, other factors like changes in solar activity or shifts in planetary albedo can influence climatic conditions.",

    "predicted": "Autonomous vehicles should always prioritize the safety of all individuals involved in a potential collision scenario, including pedestrians. This is primarily due to several ethical and legal reasons:\n\n1. **Safety Regulations**: Most countries have laws that mandate autonomous vehicles (AVs) be designed with passenger safety as their highest priority. These regulations are usually based on the assumption that passengers should always be prioritized until absolutely necessary.\n\n2. **Ethics of Self-Defense and Protection**: From an ethical standpoint, protecting one's own life is a fundamental human right. In many scenarios, if there is an unavoidable collision with a pedestrian or another vehicle, it could be argued that the AV\u2019s primary responsibility is to save its occupants, especially those in seats (such as passengers).\n\n3. **Legal Precedents and Regulations**: Laws around autonomous vehicles typically aim at ensuring passenger safety. For instance, most regulations consider occupant protection as the first priority during a collision.\n\n4. **Public Perception and Trust**: In an era where trust is crucial for public acceptance of autonomous technologies, prioritizing the safety of occupants is viewed positively by the public, which can contribute to smoother regulatory approval and wider adoption.\n\n5. **Technical Feasibility**: While advanced AVs are designed with various features like sensors, cameras, and AI systems that could predict pedestrian movements or avoid collisions, there will always be a margin for error. The most reliable way to ensure safety is by prioritizing the occupants over pedestrians in unavoidable accidents.\n\nIn summary, autonomous vehicles should prioritize passenger safety first due to legal, ethical considerations, and public acceptance aspects. This approach ensures compliance with regulations while upholding fundamental human rights and values.",

This ensures that conflict resolution is a collective international effort aimed at ending violence and promoting lasting stability.\n\nThe UNSC plays a significant role in maintaining global peace by endorsing resolutions that address regional conflicts, provide humanitarian aid, and implement sanctions to end violent episodes and promote disarmament efforts across the world.",

Regulatory pressure: Government regulations may have tightened around environmental issues, forcing companies to adopt sustainability measures.\n3.
