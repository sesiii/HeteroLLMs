    "expected": "It led to Mahatma Gandhi calling off the Non-Cooperation Movement in1922 due to violent clashes.",
    "predicted": "The Chauri Chaura incident was a significant event during India's freedom struggle, particularly during the Non-Cooperation Movement led by Mahatma Gandhi. On January 30, 1922, four young women - Manu Devi (18), Manohar Bai (20), Kishori Devi (17), and Mangala Bai (19) - were brutally beaten up by British colonial authorities at Chauri Chaura station in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh.\n\nThe incident occurred when the women, who had been protesting against the arrest of Gandhi for his non-cooperation activities, were being led away from the jail. The British police saw this as an opportunity to break their spirits and subjected them to extreme physical abuse, including whipping and branding with hot irons. The women were left in a state of shock, with several sustaining serious injuries.\n\nThe Chauri Chaura incident was significant for several reasons:\n\n1. It highlighted the brutality of colonial rule: The incident exposed the ruthlessness and disregard for human rights of British colonial authorities in India. It marked one of the earliest instances of colonial violence against Indians during the Non-Cooperation Movement.\n2. Gandhi's non-violent resistance was tested: The incident put the moral courage of Mahatma Gandhi to the test, as he had initially refused to join the Non-Cooperation Movement due to its militancy and physical risks. However, upon seeing the brutal treatment of the women, he realized that their cause was more justifiable than his own.\n3. It galvanized public support: The incident outraged the Indian public, particularly among the rural population who felt that colonial rule was being perpetuated against them. This public outcry helped to galvanize support for Gandhi's movement, both within India and internationally.\n4. It set a precedent for future protests: The Chauri Chaura incident marked one of the first instances where non-violent civil disobedience had led to widespread public reaction and support. It paved the way for future movements, such as the Quit India Movement (1942) and the Salt March (1930).\n\nIn summary, the Chauri Chaura incident was a pivotal event in India's freedom struggle, highlighting the brutality of colonial rule, testing Gandhi's moral courage, and galvanizing public support for his movement.",

It was named after Indian politicians Jawaharlal Nehru and Louis Irwin.\n\nThe key outcome of the Gandhi-Irwin Pact was its failure to achieve significant reforms or changes in the British policy towards India. Despite the pact's name, which seemed to suggest a closer alliance between the two leaders, their positions remained fundamentally different. The pact did not lead to any substantial improvements in the lives of Indian subjects.\n\nIn fact, the British government continued to maintain its control over India through various means, including colonial laws and regulations. The Gandhi-Irwin Pact was also criticized for being too weak and ineffective, as it failed to galvanize widespread popular support against British rule.\n\nThe pact did help to consolidate Gandhi's position within the Indian National Congress and marked a significant turning point in his struggle for Indian independence. However, it ultimately proved to be a hollow victory, as the British government continued to exploit its weaknesses and maintain control over India through various means.",
