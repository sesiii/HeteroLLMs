    "expected": "It led to Mahatma Gandhi calling off the Non-Cooperation Movement in1922 due to violent clashes.",
    "predicted": "The Chauri Chaura incident was a significant event that occurred on 5 February 1922 during India's movement for independence from British rule. It involved 37 people, including six women and three children, being killed by the police following an attack by Hindu villagers against local Indian Muslims who were trying to distribute salt.\n\nThe significance of this incident in India's freedom struggle is primarily:\n\n1. **Demonstration of Political Violence**: The Chauri Chaura incident demonstrated that violent political responses could lead to significant violence and loss of life, even without formal state involvement. This was a stark reminder of the brutalities that often came with nationalist movements.\n\n2. **Loss of Public Trust in Leadership**: It showed that there were divisions within the Indian National Congress (INC) leadership regarding non-violent versus violent methods, especially when it came to addressing communal issues like salt distribution to create an economic grievance based on class rather than religion.\n\n3. **Catalyzing National Awakening**: The incident triggered a national debate about how best to achieve independence and whether non-violence was the right path. It highlighted that even within organizations committed to non-violent resistance, there were differing views among leaders regarding the approach to communal problems like salt distribution.\n\n4. **Rejection of Non-Violence**: The event was a powerful rejection of non-violent methods by Indian politicians, especially those associated with the INC, which led many to seek alternative ways to achieve political change without resorting to physical violence.\n\n5. **Influence on Gandhi's Approach**: This incident is often seen as a turning point where Gandhi realized that his approach was insufficient in dealing with communal issues and he needed a more radical strategy involving armed struggle.\n\n6. **Impact on India\u2019s Independence Movement**: The event underscored the need for a more dynamic and inclusive approach to nationalist movements, considering both economic grievances and religious tensions. It influenced the eventual decision by Mahatma Gandhi to lead the Salt March (Dandi March) from 1930 onward as part of his strategic response to these divisions.\n\nThe Chauri Chaura incident was thus significant in shifting the narrative within India's independence movement, emphasizing that political methods should be more inclusive and capable of addressing all aspects of communal tensions alongside economic grievances.",

He served from August 26, 1947, to April 21, 1948, after the partition of India and Pakistan.\n2. Before becoming a viceroy, he had been Governor-General of the Straits Settlements (in modern-day Malaysia) since July 30, 1945.\n3. Mountbatten was known for his administrative skills and diplomatic acumen but faced criticism for not having the necessary experience in India or Pakistan.\n4. He retired as viceroy on April 21, 1948, after serving a full term, which extended beyond what was originally stipulated by Viceroy's Rules of Reference.\n5. The end of Mountbatten's tenure coincided with the announcement that Indian Independence would be granted shortly thereafter.\n\nThe British government appointed Lord Mountbatten to ensure stability and smooth transition in the aftermath of India's partition into two separate nations, India and Pakistan.",

    "predicted": "The Champaran Satyagraha occurred in 1917 and aimed to secure land reform for the tenants suffering under oppressive landlords. The movement was inspired by Mahatma Gandhi, a key figure in the Indian independence movement.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- The primary objective of the Champaran Satyagraha was to ensure that tenant farmers had access to the land they cultivated, thereby eliminating exploitation and increasing productivity.\n  \n- This campaign is often seen as an early instance of civil disobedience practiced by Gandhi against unjust social practices, with a focus on communal rights over private property.\n\nThe movement's main leaders included:\n1. Rajgopal Chandra Bose\n2. Bal Gangadhar Thakur\n\nThese figures were instrumental in organizing the Satyagraha, which was largely non-violent but involved peaceful protests and civil disobedience to bring about social change.\n\nThis event marked a significant step towards establishing a new dispensation of justice in India regarding land tenure and tenant rights.",

This pact aimed to resolve the Indian National Congress's demand for complete independence from British rule and to address concerns related to communal harmony.\n\nKey outcomes of the Gandhi-Irwin Pact include:\n\n- The immediate cessation of activities that could be considered \"illegal\" by the British government.\n- An agreement on non-violent methods to protest against unjust laws enacted by the British authorities.\n- A commitment by the Indian National Congress to respect the rights and feelings of religious minorities.\n\nThis pact was significant because it allowed Gandhi's movement for civil disobedience to continue without immediate legal consequences, while also signaling a willingness to dialogue with the British government. It contributed positively to India\u2019s struggle for independence, demonstrating peaceful protest as an effective strategy against colonial rule.",
