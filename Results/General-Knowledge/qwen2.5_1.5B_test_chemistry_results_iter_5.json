It can be found naturally, for example, in the venom of bees, which is why it is often used to detect insects and pests on crops.\n\nFormic acid also plays important roles in various physiological processes. For instance, in the digestive system, it aids digestion through its ability to increase the pH of the stomach, making it easier to digest certain foods.

    "expected": "Mercury is unique because it is the only metal that is liquid at room temperature; its atomic number is 80.",
    "predicted": "Mercury is unique among the metals due to several distinctive properties that set it apart from other elements in the periodic table.\n\n### Atomic Number:\nMercury has an atomic number of 80. This means it has 80 protons and, typically, 136 electrons (for a neutral atom). The element's unique nature is often attributed to its complex bonding behavior and tendency for chemical reactivity.\n\n### Unique Properties:\n\n1. **Thermal Expansion**: Mercury expands more than most metals when heated. This property makes it useful in certain applications but also complicates handling, especially at lower temperatures.\n2. **Electrolytic Conductivity**: It is a good conductor of electricity due to the delocalized electrons that make up its valence shell.\n3. **Liquify at Room Temperature**: Mercury is liquid at room temperature and only solidifies into a shiny, silvery-white metal when cooled to 260\u00b0C (490\u00b0F). This characteristic makes it particularly interesting for industrial applications requiring flexible metals with high conductivity.\n4. **Electron Affinity**: It has low electron affinity, meaning it readily loses electrons from its valence shell but struggles in gaining them due to the delocalized nature of its outer electrons.\n5. **Isotopes**: Mercury has several naturally occurring isotopes, including thallium-201 (a radioisotope) and mercury-197.\n\nThese properties make mercury a fascinating element with both practical applications and unique behaviors that set it apart from other metals.",
