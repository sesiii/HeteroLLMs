    "predicted": "The Chauri Chaura incident was a significant event in India's independence movement, particularly during the early years of Mahatma Gandhi's Non-Cooperation Movement. It occurred on November 8, 1922.\n\nOn that day, police opened fire on a group of Indian activists led by Bhanuben Devi (also known as Chauri) and Ashaprasad Datta, who were protesting against the arrest of Gandhian leader Madan Mohan Mohile Charan. The protesters were demanding the release of their colleagues who had been arrested for participating in civil disobedience activities.\n\nThe police fired shots at the protesters, killing two women (Bhanuben Devi and Sujata Pati) and wounding several others. However, one of the injured protesters, Chauri, suffered severe injuries to her leg.\n\nThe incident was a major turning point in the movement. It highlighted the government's willingness to use violence against civil disobedience activists, which further galvanized resistance among Indians. The event also exposed the contradictions between the Indian National Congress and its supporters on non-violence and the role of government agencies like police in suppressing dissent.\n\nGandhi was deeply affected by the incident and used it as a catalyst for increased activism and protests against British rule. The Chauri Chaura incident became an important symbol of resistance against oppression and a demonstration of the power of non-cooperation movements.\n\nIn the years following the incident, the Indian National Congress adopted a new policy of non-violent civil disobedience, which was largely inspired by Gandhi's philosophy of non-cooperation. The Chauri Chaura incident played a significant role in shaping India's approach to resistance and protest during its struggle for independence from British colonial rule.",

Gandhi used non-violent resistance, civil disobedience, and non-cooperation tactics to challenge the oppressive policies of the British government.\n\nThe movement gained international attention and support, with leaders such as Mahatma Gandhi, Martin Luther King Jr., and Nelson Mandela expressing their solidarity and admiration for the Champaran Satyagraha.",

Irwin, who was an American missionary and the second-in-command of the United States mission to India.\n\nThe key outcome of the pact was that Irwin agreed to abstain from supporting British authority in India during the Quit India Movement (1942-1944) and instead supported Indian independence through non-violent means. This agreement allowed Gandhi to continue his movement for Indian independence without facing opposition from a major foreign power, as expected.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that the pact was later revoked by Irwin, who became disillusioned with Gandhi's methods and the Indian National Congress's stance on violence.",
