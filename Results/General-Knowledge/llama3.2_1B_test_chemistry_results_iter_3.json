To do this, we divide by Avogadro's number (6.022 x 10^23), which represents the number of molecules in one mole:\n\nMolar mass of CO2 = 44.01 g/mol / (6.022 x 10^23)\n= 7.31 x 10^-23 g/molecule\n\nThis is an extremely small value, but it's a fundamental concept in chemistry!",

    "predicted": "In JEE Advanced level, you would learn about the properties of metals.\n\nMercury is a unique metal among metals due to its distinct chemical and physical characteristics. Here are some reasons why:\n\n1. **High melting point**: Mercury has one of the highest melting points among all elements, with a melting point of 356.73\u00b0C (674.11\u00b0F). This is due to its strong intermolecular forces, which are stronger than those in most other metals.\n2. **Boiling point**: Despite having high melting and boiling points, mercury also has a relatively low density. Its atomic number is 80, which means it has 80 protons in its atomic nucleus. The higher the atomic number, the more massive an element becomes due to the strong nuclear forces between protons.\n3. **Superfluidity**: Mercury exhibits superfluidity at very low temperatures (near absolute zero). This is a unique property among metals, as most other metals do not exhibit this phenomenon.\n4. **Intermetallic compounds**: Mercury forms intermetallic compounds with other elements, which are composed of multiple metals and their ions. These compounds have unique physical properties, such as high thermal conductivity and electrical resistivity.\n\nThe atomic number of mercury is 80, which means it has 80 protons in its atomic nucleus.",
