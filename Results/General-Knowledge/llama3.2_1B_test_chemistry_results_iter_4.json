    "expected": "Mercury is unique because it is the only metal that is liquid at room temperature; its atomic number is 80.",
    "predicted": "Mercury's uniqueness can be attributed to its electronic configuration, which is highly stable due to the presence of a few key features:\n\n1. **Low ionization energy**: Mercury has a relatively low ionization energy compared to other metals. This means that it requires less energy to remove an electron from the outermost energy level, making it difficult for mercury to form positive ions.\n2. **High electronegativity**: Mercury has a high electronegativity value (6.59 on the Pauling scale), which indicates its strong ability to attract electrons. This makes it challenging for mercury to lose electrons easily, resulting in a relatively stable electronic configuration.\n3. **Low atomic number and ionization energy**: Mercury's atomic number is 80. Due to the presence of a full outer energy level (s and p orbitals fully occupied), mercury has a low tendency to lose electrons.\n\nThe unique combination of these characteristics leads to mercury being a stable element with a relatively long half-life, which makes it useful for various industrial applications.",
