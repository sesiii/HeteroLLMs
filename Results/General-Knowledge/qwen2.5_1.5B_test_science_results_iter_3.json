    "predicted": "To prevent the filament from oxidizing and causing a decrease in electrical conductivity, which would result in the bulb breaking due to increased resistance over time, common gases used in electric light bulbs include argon (Ar) and nitrogen (N2).\n\nThese noble gases are chosen for their inertness\u2014they have low reactivity with other elements. This means that they do not react with the filament or any component inside the bulb, reducing the risk of oxidation.\n\nIn some cases, an additional gas such as helium (He), neon (Ne), or krypton (Kr) may be added to enhance the light output by filling a specific range of wavelengths. However, the primary gases used for preventing oxidation are argon and nitrogen.\n\nIt's worth noting that older electric light bulbs often contained mercury vapor as well, but this is becoming less common due to health concerns with mercury exposure.",

    "predicted": "The primary source of energy for Earth's climate system is the Sun, which provides about 99% of the solar radiation received on the surface. This energy drives many processes in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere and oceans that regulate our planet's temperature and weather patterns. For example:\n\n1. Solar Radiation: The sun emits a broad spectrum of electromagnetic waves, including visible light, ultraviolet rays, and infrared radiation.\n2. Greenhouse Effect: As these solar-waves pass through the Earth's atmosphere, some are absorbed by greenhouse gases like water vapor, carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and others to warm the surface and lower levels of the troposphere. This warming is known as the greenhouse effect.\n3. Solar Wind & Ultraviolet Rays: The sun also emits energetic solar wind particles that can interact with Earth\u2019s magnetic field and produce phenomena like auroras at high latitudes, while ultraviolet rays contribute indirectly by providing energy for the formation of ozone in the stratosphere.\n\nThe Sun's radiation not only warms the surface but also causes seasonal changes through variations in seasons (seasonal warming/cooling) due to tilt angle and Earth's orbit. These effects collectively make up one quarter of the total climate system heat budget, influencing temperature variability on both short-term timescales like weather patterns and longer durations such as climate shifts over geological periods.",

The most abundant isotope, carbon-12, is used in the common isotope ratio method to determine age through radiocarbon dating.\n\n5. **Role in Respiration**: It's a fundamental element in biological oxidation processes like respiration, where it plays crucial roles in the breakdown of organic compounds for energy.\n\n6. **Molecular Shapes**: Its versatility allows it to form complex and varied structures within molecules, contributing significantly to the diversity seen in life.\n\n7. **Environmental Impact**: Carbon is also crucial in many environmental contexts, particularly related to climate change due to its role in atmospheric CO2 levels and carbon cycling processes.",

    "expected": "A kilonova is a transient astronomical event caused by the collision of two neutron stars or a neutron star and a black hole, producing heavy elements and a burst of electromagnetic radiation.",
    "predicted": "A \"kilonova\" refers to the phenomenon of an extremely massive star collapsing into a neutron star or a black hole, typically resulting in a supernova. However, unlike typical supernovae that result from the collapse and explosion of massive stars at the end of their lives (stellar explosions), this one occurs much earlier, usually within just a few weeks after the formation of these first-generation heavy elements.\n\nThis particular type is associated with what scientists refer to as \"core-collapse\" supernovae. These occur when extremely massive, young stars that are more than 15 times the mass of our Sun reach the end of their life cycle and collapse in on themselves before they have had a chance to blow off all the outer layers of gas.\n\nThe primary significant astronomical event associated with kilonovas is the detection of high-energy gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). A kilonova, accompanied by these GRBs, typically results from two neutron stars spiraling towards each other and merging. The gravitational waves emitted during this merger cause brief but intense electromagnetic radiation bursts that can be detected on Earth.\n\nThese events are extremely rare due to the extreme conditions required for such a massive collapse and subsequent explosion of an infant black hole or neutron star system. The kilonova produces an enormous amount of energy, equaling up to many supernovas in total luminosity, with some being observed across several galaxies.",
