    "predicted": "A rarefied air mixture with helium and neon is commonly filled in electric bulbs to prevent filament oxidation. This type of gas mixture is called an inert gas atmosphere, which provides an environment that slows down the reaction between the metal and oxygen atoms, effectively preventing corrosion or rusting on the surface of the filament.\n\nHere's why this method works:\n\n1. **Helium**: Helium has a very low reactivity with metals due to its noble gas properties. When combined with other inert gases like neon, it creates an almost completely inert environment.\n  \n2. **Neon and Other Inert Gases**: Neon is highly unreactive as well because of the nature of its outermost electron shell (the same reason helium's reactivity is low). The combination results in a significant reduction of oxidation reactions compared to pure air.\n\nThis mixture not only extends the life of the filament but also enhances light transmission by preventing the formation of condensation and other impurities that can cause poor performance. This is why such rarefied gas atmospheres are used extensively in electric bulbs, especially those designed for long-lasting operation.",

This arrangement gives diamonds their extraordinary hardness, making them the hardest material found in nature without the use of heat treatment or any artificial modification.\n\nSome key properties and facts about diamonds include:\n\n1. Origin: Diamonds form deep within Earth's mantle under extreme pressure (over 50,000 times that at sea level) over millions of years via a process called high-pressure transformation.\n2. Formation time: The formation takes place in the range of tens to several hundred million years depending on depth and initial temperature.\n3. Occurrence: Diamonds are rare, with only about one part per trillion forming under normal Earth conditions. Therefore, they're relatively expensive and valuable gems or industrial materials due to their scarcity.\n4. Geology: They can be found in various types of rocks like kimberlite pipes which form at depths from 150-760 kilometers below the surface.\n\nDiamonds are not only used for jewelry but also in cutting tools, laboratory equipment, and electronic components thanks to their hardness and thermal conductivity properties.",

    "predicted": "A \"kilonova\" is an extremely energetic supernova explosion that occurs when the core of a massive star collapses under its own gravity, releasing energy equivalent to many kilotons or even megatons of TNT. This catastrophic collapse results in a highly luminous and short-duration event.\n\nThe term \"Kilonova\" was coined by astronomers who discovered it as a rare phenomenon associated with the explosion of a white dwarf star that has been accreting material from a companion star, often a neutron star or black hole. The kilonova emits gravitational waves alongside the light, which provides additional information about its source.\n\nOne significant astronomical event related to kilonovae is the detection of gravitational waves coming from two merging black holes in 2015 by LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory). This was a major breakthrough and led scientists to predict the creation of heavy elements, such as gold and platinum, through the process of neutron star mergers. These kilonovae are expected to be one way to create these rare materials.\n\nIn summary, while kilonovae themselves do not represent any single astronomical event, they play a crucial role in understanding how black holes form and interact with other celestial bodies, particularly when combined with the detection of gravitational waves from binary neutron star mergers.",
