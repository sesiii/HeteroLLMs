It's also a major component of stars and other celestial objects.\n\nRegarding the gas that was discovered on the sun before Earth, I'm assuming you're referring to helium. Helium was indeed detected for the first time by Italian astronomer Gaspare Fabbiani in 1868, who observed it coming from the surface of the sun using a spectrograph. This discovery helped establish the existence of the sun and its role as a source of energy for our solar system.\n\nAs for your second question, I'm not aware of any information that suggests helium is the second most abundant element in the universe after hydrogen. Hydrogen is still the most abundant element, and it's unlikely to be surpassed anytime soon.",

    "expected": "Mercury is unique because it is the only metal that is liquid at room temperature; its atomic number is 80.",
    "predicted": "In JEE Advanced level, the concept of atomic number and periodic trends are crucial for understanding the properties of elements.\n\nMercury (Hg) has an atomic number of 80. This means that it has 80 protons in the nucleus of its atoms. One of the unique features of mercury is that it exhibits a combination of characteristics from both alkali metals and noble gases due to its electronic configuration.\n\nIn its ground state, mercury has 82 electrons, which are arranged in the following electron configuration: [Xe] 4f14 5d10 6s2. The outermost energy level is filled with 12 electrons, whereas the inner energy levels are fully occupied by 80 electrons.\n\nNow, let's analyze why mercury is unique among metals:\n\n1. **Low ionization energy**: Mercury has a relatively low ionization energy, which means it can easily lose its outermost electron to form a positive ion (Hg\u00b2\u207a). This property makes mercury a highly reactive metal.\n2. **High electronegativity**: Mercury has a high electronegativity value of 3.20 on the Pauling scale, which is one of the highest among all elements. This means it has a strong tendency to attract electrons towards itself, making it difficult for other atoms or molecules to form stable bonds with mercury.\n3. **Low melting and boiling points**: Mercury has very low melting and boiling points (-38.8\u00b0C and -34.6\u00b0C, respectively), which is due to its high reactivity and low intermolecular forces.\n\nThe combination of these properties makes mercury a unique metal that exhibits characteristics from both alkali metals and noble gases. Its electronic configuration, with a full outer energy level and low ionization energy, is particularly interesting and has led to its applications in various technologies, such as thermometers, barometers, and fluorescent lamps.",
