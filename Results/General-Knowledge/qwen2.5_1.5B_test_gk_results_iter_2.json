The name \"Bras\u00edlia\" means \"City of the Goddess,\" reflecting the original purpose for which it was designed.\n\nSome interesting facts about Bras\u00edlia:\n\n1. It is located on the left bank of the Grande Ilha River.\n2. It has no natural water resources within its boundaries, thus relying entirely on imported water from upstream.\n3. The city lies in an area prone to earthquakes and experiences seismic activity.\n4. The city itself has never been visited by a monarch, with only two presidents having ever lived there: Jo\u00e3o Goulart (1956-1960) and Jango [Julio da Silva] Nasser (1975-1985), who were both military officers rather than political leaders.\n5. The city is known for its unique architectural style, with buildings designed by Oscar Niemeyer and L\u00facio Costa.\n\nBras\u00edlia was intentionally planned as a modernist city to be a model of 20th-century urban design. It has since become one of the most populous cities in Brazil, housing approximately 3.9 million people.",

They are also very social animals, living together in groups called prides which can consist of up to 30 females, a few adult males, and subadults. Lions primarily hunt by stalking their prey from a distance before attacking with coordinated attacks.\n\nLions live mainly in grasslands, savannas, steppes, open woodlands, forests, and deserts where they can easily ambush their prey or chase it down over long distances. Their strong jaws are perfect for tearing flesh, while their large claws help them to catch and kill their prey with ease.",

    "predicted": "The \"Land of the Rising Sun\" refers to Japan, which is also called \"Nippon\" or \"Nihon\". This name has a deep historical and cultural meaning:\n\n1. **Rising Sun Symbolism**: In Japanese culture, particularly in traditional art and literature, the rising sun (represented by the character for \"sun\", \u65e5) symbolizes life, vitality, and prosperity. The phrase \"Land of the Rising Sun\" is metaphorically used to refer to Japan because it was historically thought that the country's unique geographical location allowed its sunrise to be viewed from far away, thus being a place where light first appeared on the horizon.\n\n2. **Historical Context**: This name has historical roots in ancient Japanese literature and mythology. The phrase \"Nippon\" or \"Nihon\" is believed to have been used as early as 7th century China when it was written by Japanese Buddhist monks who were studying in China. By the 11th century, this term had gained widespread use among Japan's ruling classes.\n\n3. **Cultural Significance**: This name has become deeply ingrained in Japanese culture and is still widely used today. It reflects a sense of pride and continuity with the country\u2019s historical and cultural heritage. The term \"Land of the Rising Sun\" also emphasizes Japan as an island nation, separate from its neighbors, which contributes to its distinct cultural identity.\n\nIn summary, \"Land of the Rising Sun\" refers to Japan because it is thought that the country's unique geographical position allows for a spectacular sunrise view, symbolizing the beginning of the new day. This name encapsulates a sense of national pride and historical significance in Japanese culture.",
