    "expected": "Argon",
    "predicted": "The gas commonly used to fill electric bulbs to prevent filament oxidation is Argon (Ar). However, the primary purpose of filling an incandescent bulb with any gas is to prevent air from getting into it. The main reason for this is that a vacuum or inert gas like Argon can keep out moisture and oxygen, which could cause corrosion or deterioration over time.\n\nIt's worth noting that in modern light bulbs (LEDs), the filament isn't often filled with gases because these LEDs don't require filaments at all. Instead, they use different methods to produce their light output through diodes or other technologies, and thus don't need traditional filament-filled glass tubes.",

The Sun emits electromagnetic radiation in various forms, including visible light and infrared heat waves, which travel through space until they hit objects on our planet like clouds or surfaces. These objects then radiate back some of this energy in all directions; a fraction is reflected back into space, while most goes into warming the surface.\n\nThe Earth's climate system absorbs this incoming sunlight and converts it to thermal energy that warms the surface, oceans, and atmosphere. This process creates weather patterns on small scales (like wind, rain, clouds) and large ones (climate patterns like seasons). The Sun also emits heat at longer wavelengths absorbed by greenhouse gases in the atmosphere such as water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, ozone, and others.\n\nThus, without solar radiation or its conversion to thermal energy, Earth's climate system would likely be much colder. This balance is maintained on a larger scale due to complex feedback processes involving clouds, aerosols, oceans, landmasses, sea ice, and more.",
