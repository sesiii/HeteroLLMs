This property makes argon an ideal choice for protecting materials like tungsten filaments in incandescent lamps or neon lights. By filling the bulb with pure argon, the light-emitting element can be protected from atmospheric moisture and oxygen that could cause corrosion.\n\nWhile some types of gas are used as fillers, such as nitrogen, helium, or carbon dioxide, argon is especially popular for its inertness in protecting electronic materials against oxidation and deterioration.",

The most commonly known naturally occurring substance with a hardness measurement exceeding 7 is corundum, also known as ruby and sapphire. \n\nRuby has a Mohs hardness of 9 while sapphires have a hardness ranging between 9 and 9.5.\n\nHowever, if we're considering the hardest naturally occurring materials in terms of its ability to withstand extreme conditions, such as high temperatures or pressures without deforming significantly, then it would be extremely challenging to determine which substance is \"the hardest.\" \n\nIn many contexts, diamond has been referred to as having the highest hardness because it exhibits a very low coefficient of thermal expansion and resistance to chemical corrosion. It also provides excellent lubrication properties due to its highly ordered crystalline structure.\n\nFor example:\n- Diamond's hardness means that under extreme conditions (such as in space) or high temperatures, diamond could theoretically withstand enormous force without fracturing.\n  \nDiamond is so hard it can cut through other materials such as glass and even steel. Its chemical inertness also makes diamonds an excellent abrasive material used for cutting metal jewelry, sharpening tools, and more.\n\nHowever, the term \"the hardest naturally occurring substance\" generally refers to a mineral known as diamond rather than ruby or sapphire, due to its unique combination of physical and chemical properties.",

This discovery was made on September 4, 2017, when an enigmatic signal was detected that could not be explained by any known astrophysical process.\n\nThis cosmic event has been associated with merging neutron stars (which typically occur in binary star systems) and may provide insights into the extreme environments found at the centers of galaxies. The kilonova is a prime example of how astronomical observations can reveal new phenomena and help us better understand our universe's most violent and energetic events.",
