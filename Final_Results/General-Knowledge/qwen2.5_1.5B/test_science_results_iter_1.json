    "expected": "Argon",
    "predicted": "To determine which gas is commonly used in electric light bulbs to prevent the oxidation of the filament, we need to consider the properties and safety requirements of such gases.\n\n1. **Safety Considerations**:\n    - The gas should be non-toxic.\n    - It must not react chemically with the metal components (like copper for wiring) or with the glass envelope in any harmful way.\n    - There should be no risk of ignition if exposed to heat sources, which is typical in a light bulb.\n\n2. **Common Gases Used**:\n    - **Oxygen**: While oxygen would not harm the filament, it could potentially ignite other materials around it.\n    - **Nitrogen**: Nitrogen does not react with metals or glass and is non-toxic but is slightly heavier than air.\n    - **Carbon Dioxide (CO2)**: CO2 can be used as a protective gas because of its inert properties. It does not react chemically, it's relatively safe to handle compared to oxygen, and it doesn't contribute significantly to the weight or size of the bulb.\n\n3. **Specific Application**:\n    - In electric light bulbs, nitrogen is commonly used due to several advantages:\n        - Nitrogen has a higher boiling point than carbon dioxide (CO2), which means that once inside the bulb, CO2 would slowly escape over time through the glass.\n        - It is non-toxic and does not react with metals or glass in any harmful way.\n        - The low density of nitrogen makes it easy to fill and evacuate efficiently.\n\n4. **Final Gas Selection**:\n    - Given these considerations, the safest gas for preventing filament oxidation and ensuring safety is **nitrogen**.\n\nTherefore, the gas commonly filled in electric bulbs to prevent the oxidation of the filament is \\boxed{\\text{Nitrogen}}.",

Its ability to form complex structures through covalent bonds allows it to be a fundamental component in life's building blocks: DNA, RNA, and ATP.

    "predicted": "A \"kilonova\" refers to the explosion of a relatively small, dense star known as a neutron star. This type of explosion releases an enormous amount of energy due to the extreme density and strong gravitational fields of the neutron star, leading to a supernova event.\n\nThe kilonova associated with significant astronomical events is usually in the context of detecting gravitational waves from merging black holes or neutron stars through observations that also include electromagnetic counterparts such as gamma-ray bursts. These events are incredibly rare occurrences but provide unique insights into extreme physical processes within the universe.\n\nIn more detail, a kilonova happens when two neutron stars orbit each other and eventually merge to form a single black hole. The gravitational waves generated by this process travel through space-time at the speed of light, resulting in a signal detectable on Earth from LIGO or similar observatories. At the same time, electromagnetic radiation (gamma rays) is released during the supernova explosion that follows.\n\nThis event marks significant progress in astrophysics as it allows scientists to study extreme conditions far beyond what can be achieved with traditional ground-based telescopes or satellite observations alone. The combined use of gravitational wave detectors and optical/infrared/ultraviolet cameras from Earth also provides crucial information about the nature of black holes and neutron stars, their masses, sizes, spin rates, magnetic fields, etc.\n\nSo while a kilonova itself is an event where two dense objects collide, it often serves as evidence for other celestial phenomena like black hole mergers detected via gravitational waves.",
