    "expected": "4",
    "predicted": "To convert the bicycle's speed from feet per minute to inches per second, we need to first convert the units of measurement.\n\nThere are 12 inches in a foot, so:\n\n20 feet/minute \u00d7 12 inches/foot = 240 inches/minute\n\nNow, we need to convert the time from minutes to seconds. There are 60 seconds in a minute, so:\n\n240 inches/minute \u00f7 60 seconds/minute = 4 inches/second",
