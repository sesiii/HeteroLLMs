i am working on a framework that autonomously assigns suitable LLM for a given task in a Multi agent system from a pool of LLMs,
 after looking at the score matrix-which is essentially the matrix that contains data for each model tested across several domain of tasks which further contain sub domains, 
 The framwork uses agentic ai that hosts the score matrix through an mcp server, when given input from the MAS, 
 will map the input to the most closests domain-subdomain or domain-none  pairs for each model and computes as score(weighted score of the latency, accuracy and memory), 
 higher the accuracy, the model will be picked and assigned to the MAS for that task.
